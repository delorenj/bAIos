# bAIos Agent System Testing Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the bAIos agent system, specifically designed to validate Checkpoint 2 requirements.

## Test Files

### 1. `test_agent_commands.py` - Comprehensive Automated Testing
**Primary test suite** that will automatically validate all agent system functionality.

**Features:**
- Waits for agent implementation (up to 5 minutes)
- Tests all four required agents: BillTheCoordinator, MiseMaster, TzviTheWindowsWizard, Shelldon
- Validates exact Checkpoint 2 scenario: `baios agent ask Shelldon "Is zsh my default shell?"`
- Performance testing (response times)
- Error handling validation
- Integration flow testing
- Comprehensive reporting with JSON output

**Usage:**
```bash
cd /home/delorenj/code/AIOnboarding/bAIos/cli
python tests/test_agent_commands.py
```

### 2. `monitor_agent_implementation.py` - Continuous Monitoring
Continuously monitors for agent command implementation and triggers comprehensive tests when ready.

**Features:**
- Periodic checking (every 30 seconds)
- Automatic test execution when agents become available
- Progress tracking and logging
- Configurable timeout and check intervals

**Usage:**
```bash
python tests/monitor_agent_implementation.py
```

### 3. `manual_validation_checklist.py` - Interactive Testing
Step-by-step manual validation guide for thorough testing.

**Features:**
- Interactive command execution
- Manual verification prompts
- Detailed results tracking
- User-friendly validation workflow

**Usage:**
```bash
python tests/manual_validation_checklist.py
```

### 4. `test_current_functionality.py` - Baseline Testing
Tests current CLI functionality to ensure no regressions.

**Usage:**
```bash
python tests/test_current_functionality.py
```

### 5. `test_check_integration.py` - Checkpoint 1 Validation
Existing test for `baios check` command (Checkpoint 1).

## Expected Agent Commands

Based on Checkpoint 2 requirements, the following commands should be implemented:

```bash
# List all available agents
baios agent list

# Expected output:
# BillTheCoordinator
# MiseMaster
# TzviTheWindowsWizard
# Shelldon

# Ask a specific question to an agent
baios agent ask Shelldon "Is zsh my default shell?"

# Expected output:
# Shelldon: Yes, zsh is your default shell.
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### Automated Testing (Recommended)
1. Run the monitor script to continuously check for implementation:
   ```bash
   python tests/monitor_agent_implementation.py
   ```

### Manual Testing
1. Check current baseline functionality:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_current_functionality.py
   ```

2. When agent commands are ready, run comprehensive tests:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_agent_commands.py
   ```

3. For detailed manual validation:
   ```bash
   python tests/manual_validation_checklist.py
   ```

## Test Results

Test results are saved to `agent_test_results.json` for analysis and reporting.

## Required Agents

According to Checkpoint 2, the system must include these four agents:

1. **BillTheCoordinator** - Main coordination agent
2. **MiseMaster** - Tool management specialist  
3. **TzviTheWindowsWizard** - Windows tools specialist
4. **Shelldon** - Shell and command-line specialist

## Checkpoint 2 Validation Criteria

- ✅ `baios agent list` shows all four agents
- ✅ `baios agent ask Shelldon "Is zsh my default shell?"` returns appropriate response
- ✅ All agents can respond to questions
- ✅ Error handling works for invalid agents/questions
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (< 30s response times)
- ✅ Integration flow works end-to-end

## Status

**Current Status**: Waiting for agent command implementation

The test framework is complete and ready. Once the agent commands (`baios agent list` and `baios agent ask`) are implemented, the comprehensive test suite will automatically validate all functionality.

## Quality Assurance Notes

All tests are designed to be:
- **Comprehensive** - Cover all requirements and edge cases
- **Automated** - Run without manual intervention
- **Reliable** - Consistent results across runs  
- **Informative** - Clear reporting of successes and failures
- **Performance-aware** - Monitor response times
- **Integration-focused** - Test complete user workflows
