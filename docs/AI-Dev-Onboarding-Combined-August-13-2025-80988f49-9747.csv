"So wherever you guys code, I guess as a sibling to the Trinote directory.","00:03","00:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, I take it back.","00:12","00:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Everybody on a Mac.","00:15","00:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Do we.","00:17","00:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Can we.","00:17","00:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Can we guarantee everybody's on Mac except for Zvi?","00:17","00:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Is that the case?","00:21","00:22",0,"speaker 1"
"No, I'm on Windows.","00:24","00:25",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, so Maki's on Windows and see.","00:26","00:31",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so anybody on Windows is going to need.","00:31","00:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, wait, Janine too.","00:36","00:37",0,"speaker 1"
"So we pretty much only myself on Mac.","00:37","00:39",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","00:40","00:41",0,"speaker 1"
"And I would have tailored this more to Windows, but that's all right.","00:44","00:50",0,"speaker 1"
"It's fine.","00:50","00:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Because wsl, I think, is on par and sometimes better than Mac.","00:50","00:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's fine as long as that's going to have to be a prerequisite step.","01:00","01:04",0,"speaker 1"
"So how many of you Windows folk have WSL enabled?","01:05","01:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's get off of my mute.","01:13","01:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Everybody, let's make it like a joint meeting.","01:14","01:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So please speak up.","01:17","01:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I just enabled it.","01:19","01:20",1,"speaker 2"
"You just enabled it.","01:23","01:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Awesome.","01:25","01:25",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not.","01:30","01:30",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not Jer.","01:30","01:34",0,"speaker 1"
"So previously to wsl you would have to dual boot into Linux and it was a pain.","01:35","01:42",0,"speaker 1"
"So you would have either Windows or Linux.","01:42","01:44",0,"speaker 1"
"But.","01:44","01:45",0,"speaker 1"
"But that's not good.","01:45","01:47",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not fun.","01:47","01:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So Windows added this kernel layer.","01:48","01:51",0,"speaker 1"
"It has Linux support at the very core of Windows.","01:51","01:55",0,"speaker 1"
"And at first I was skeptical, but it is, you know, it's generally considered amazing how they did it.","01:55","02:02",0,"speaker 1"
"And it is good, right?","02:02","02:03",0,"speaker 1"
"So somehow they managed to make it.","02:03","02:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So even though it's Linux and Windows together, you can access the files cross like you could be in Windows and open a Linux.","02:05","02:15",0,"speaker 1"
"One of the Linux files that are on your computer and not really even know it's a Linux file, which is amazing.","02:15","02:20",0,"speaker 1"
"So we're gonna.","02:22","02:22",0,"speaker 1"
"We're gonna.","02:22","02:23",0,"speaker 1"
"What was that?","02:23","02:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Just showing it on my screen.","02:24","02:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh yeah.","02:26","02:27",0,"speaker 1"
"I am.","02:27","02:27",0,"speaker 1"
"I am Linux.","02:27","02:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Nice.","02:30","02:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Amazing.","02:32","02:33",0,"speaker 1"
"So the way that you're gonna work with it, as far as you're concerned is.","02:33","02:37",0,"speaker 1"
"So now the thing that could be confusing is when you install, let's say VS Code or Cursor, you could install Cursor in the Linux side, or you can install it on the Windows side and you will not install it on the Linux side.","02:38","02:56",0,"speaker 1"
"You'll do everything on Windows still.","02:56","02:58",0,"speaker 1"
"So like Claude Desktop, when you install that, you're going to install it on Windows just like you normally do.","02:58","03:04",0,"speaker 1"
"But when you are in the terminal and you're typing things into your terminal, you won't open that stupid powershell that you always have to open in Windows.","03:05","03:15",0,"speaker 1"
"You'll open a, like a Zish terminal, a Z shell or a Bash, just like you would On Mac.","03:15","03:23",0,"speaker 1"
"So you get the best of both worlds.","03:23","03:25",0,"speaker 1"
"I could open Bash without Linux and all that stuff.","03:28","03:31",0,"speaker 1"
"How Git has a bash.","03:32","03:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but that's a.","03:37","03:38",0,"speaker 1"
"That's a.","03:38","03:38",0,"speaker 1"
"That's a sandboxed environment, right?","03:38","03:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So like, if you open that, Git has a bash, but your slash home is like, it's.","03:40","03:46",0,"speaker 1"
"You know, it's almost like a.","03:46","03:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Another machine called git.","03:47","03:49",0,"speaker 1"
"I know because I used to use that.","03:51","03:53",0,"speaker 1"
"I hated PowerShell, I would use that.","03:53","03:55",0,"speaker 1"
"But git.","03:55","03:56",0,"speaker 1"
"This is better because this terminal crosses the barrier between the Linux side and the Windows side.","03:56","04:03",0,"speaker 1"
"All you have to do to get to it, there's a bunch of ways.","04:06","04:08",0,"speaker 1"
"But when you open PowerShell, you type WSL and then enter and then you'll be in your Linux box.","04:08","04:16",0,"speaker 1"
"That's how I recommend doing it.","04:20","04:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Or you can even pin.","04:22","04:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Pin a terminal to your Start menu or a shortcut key and it just opens a window and you'll be in zish, just like you would be on a Mac.","04:24","04:32",0,"speaker 1"
"And you know, that's the top layer of it.","04:35","04:38",0,"speaker 1"
"But the bottom layer is all of the tools we'll be using.","04:38","04:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Most of them only work in Linux.","04:44","04:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","04:50","04:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes, svi, even though you have G, you have a Bash terminal, it still will only run exes.","04:50","04:56",0,"speaker 1"
"You can't install Linux stuff using that Git terminal, which is really the main reason why we can't use that.","04:57","05:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Let me join everybody.","05:05","05:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Go to your.","05:08","05:09",0,"speaker 1"
"You should have a directory that you consider like your code directory.","05:09","05:14",0,"speaker 1"
"I call mine code and that's just where I go and clone everything.","05:14","05:19",0,"speaker 1"
"If you're in wsl, I usually just make that my home directory.","05:20","05:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's like tilde.","05:25","05:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Jared, why don't you share your screen?","05:28","05:29",0,"speaker 1"
"It's easier.","05:29","05:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I wish I had my Windows machine so I can show you guys.","05:30","05:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Because I'm sure if you're a Windows person, you would love to click on the Explorer and see and we'll do it on your.","05:34","05:42",0,"speaker 1"
"On your computer.","05:42","05:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","05:44","05:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","05:45","05:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I like that.","05:45","05:46",0,"speaker 1"
"I have this.","05:46","05:47",0,"speaker 1"
"I have this little.","05:47","05:48",0,"speaker 1"
"What's it called?","05:49","05:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Thing pinned over here.","05:51","05:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So I click on this and I do Launch.","05:52","05:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I got this.","05:57","05:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry.","06:08","06:08",0,"speaker 1"
"A lot of things.","06:09","06:10",0,"speaker 1"
"It's so blinky.","06:14","06:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","06:16","06:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","06:16","06:16",0,"speaker 1"
"How did you.","06:18","06:19",0,"speaker 1"
"What is this tab that?","06:19","06:20",0,"speaker 1"
"What is this?","06:21","06:21",0,"speaker 1"
"This is wsl.","06:22","06:23",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the Linux.","06:23","06:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, what did you.","06:25","06:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Did you.","06:26","06:26",0,"speaker 1"
"How did you open this?","06:27","06:28",0,"speaker 1"
"I have this little guy on the bottom here, this little penguin, I guess.","06:30","06:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Huh.","06:34","06:35",0,"speaker 1"
"And I just clicked on Launch.","06:36","06:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","06:39","06:39",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","06:39","06:40",0,"speaker 1"
"You could also type that probably into the search.","06:40","06:41",0,"speaker 1"
"No, you don't Even have to do it for me.","06:41","06:42",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","06:44","06:44",0,"speaker 1"
"What happens if you double type WSL EXE into the search?","06:44","06:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Does that work too?","06:47","06:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it works.","06:50","06:51",0,"speaker 1"
"And you?","06:51","06:52",0,"speaker 1"
"I type Ubuntu.","06:52","06:53",0,"speaker 1"
"See where it says Ubuntu?","06:53","06:54",0,"speaker 1"
"That's more explicit because at least you know you're going into a Ubuntu machine right now.","06:54","06:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Same thing.","06:58","06:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, same thing.","06:59","07:01",0,"speaker 1"
"But once you pin it like you have yet Penguin, you don't need to.","07:01","07:04",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, just click on it.","07:04","07:05",0,"speaker 1"
"It's like you'll click on it more times than anything else.","07:05","07:08",0,"speaker 1"
"That's the goal.","07:08","07:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, now?","07:09","07:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, keep going.","07:11","07:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Jared, if you've been working on WSL for a while, Malky, I guess you're.","07:11","07:18",0,"speaker 1"
"You haven't because you enabled it.","07:18","07:20",0,"speaker 1"
"The first thing I would do is create a code directory in your home and see if you have.","07:21","07:26",0,"speaker 1"
"You have a directory that you consider your GitHub clone directory.","07:26","07:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","07:31","07:31",0,"speaker 1"
"And what's that?","07:32","07:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Source Repos Store.","07:34","07:39",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","07:39","07:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Source Repos.","07:40","07:42",0,"speaker 1"
"I missed it again.","07:43","07:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Cut out.","07:45","07:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Store slash.","07:45","07:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Repos.","07:46","07:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","07:47","07:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Did I hear you right?","07:47","07:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Repos right here.","07:48","07:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, source.","07:50","07:51",0,"speaker 1"
"I couldn't hear that first word.","07:52","07:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Source is in your home directory.","07:55","07:57",0,"speaker 1"
"No, I'm looking at Windows here.","07:59","08:01",0,"speaker 1"
"This is Windows.","08:01","08:01",0,"speaker 1"
"So I'm a little confused.","08:01","08:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","08:03","08:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, gotcha.","08:03","08:05",0,"speaker 1"
"I didn't set it up here yet.","08:05","08:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Got it.","08:08","08:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so let's just.","08:08","08:09",0,"speaker 1"
"You can call it Repos.","08:11","08:12",0,"speaker 1"
"It should be on the top level because it'll be easier access with a tilde.","08:13","08:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So I would do a.","08:16","08:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Make.","08:18","08:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Mkdir.","08:18","08:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","08:22","08:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Mkdir.","08:23","08:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Mkdir.","08:26","08:27",0,"speaker 1"
"And then space repos actually makes more sense than code.","08:27","08:33",0,"speaker 1"
"But I had code for like 15 years and I just can't change it.","08:33","08:37",0,"speaker 1"
"It's built in my brain.","08:37","08:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So now go to now.","08:38","08:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Something really good about Linux and Ubuntu and all that is this standard they came up with of where configs go and where your bio binaries go.","08:42","08:52",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's in your.","08:52","08:53",0,"speaker 1"
"As long as you're in your home directory here and you can tell by doing tilde, you can do like.","08:53","09:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","09:01","09:01",0,"speaker 1"
"LS would.","09:01","09:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, Tilde is like the character tilde.","09:02","09:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So if you do CD for change directory and then the tilde, which is next to the number one on your keyboard, it's like a shift.","09:05","09:12",0,"speaker 1"
"And then next to one.","09:13","09:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's it.","09:14","09:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So that will take you home.","09:15","09:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Now that works on Mac and that also works in Linux, but it's super annoying.","09:17","09:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Probably the worst thing I hate that made my life suck is Mac.","09:23","09:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Your home is/users zvi.","09:27","09:31",0,"speaker 1"
"And in Linux it's home SV and the only way to normalize that is tilde, which works most of the time.","09:32","09:41",0,"speaker 1"
"But config files don't understand it.","09:41","09:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Your TOML files, your JSON file, they don't understand it and it doesn't expand it.","09:44","09:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Just remember, home TV is now your home.","09:49","09:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Your configs.","09:54","09:55",0,"speaker 1"
"I want you to go to CD to change directory into dot When I say dot config, that's like period config.","09:57","10:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Just like Macs.","10:08","10:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","10:10","10:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Config.","10:11","10:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, without the S. Yeah.","10:13","10:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Now just like a MacBook, the Dot makes it hidden.","10:14","10:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So if you're ever using AI and it doesn't see your file and it's like, oh, I don't see that file.","10:19","10:24",0,"speaker 1"
"It, it doesn't look into dot files by default, which also I hate.","10:25","10:30",0,"speaker 1"
"I try to make it.","10:30","10:31",0,"speaker 1"
"I try to add rules to say please, please look at my dot files.","10:31","10:34",0,"speaker 1"
"But you're in a file directory now.","10:35","10:39",0,"speaker 1"
"If you do an ls, this is the place when you install a new app, when you install something, this is where they put the configs.","10:39","10:48",0,"speaker 1"
"If it's a good, if they're cool, sometimes they'll put it in the root, whatever.","10:48","10:52",0,"speaker 1"
"But most things now go here.","10:52","10:54",0,"speaker 1"
"What I'm going to have you clone is a new thing that I made for Triumph Devs, which is going to standardize all of our configs, all of our environments, all of our secrets, all that stuff.","10:54","11:05",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's called Zishy Zish because that's what I named it because I didn't think I would anyone else.","11:06","11:13",0,"speaker 1"
"I can't do that here though, right?","11:15","11:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah.","11:17","11:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So I want you to do a.","11:17","11:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So first you're going to need GitHub, everyone's going to need GitHub.","11:19","11:23",0,"speaker 1"
"And when I say GitHub, I mean not the normal way that we clone, like git, clone, whatever.","11:23","11:32",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the GitHub API, which makes things easier.","11:32","11:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's see if it's there.","11:35","11:36",0,"speaker 1"
"If you type G H enter, does it work right here on config?","11:36","11:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, just type GH enter you don't have it.","11:41","11:47",0,"speaker 1"
"But don't listen to that snap crap.","11:47","11:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Snap.","11:51","11:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Snap is like, you know, it's like a homebrew.","11:51","11:55",0,"speaker 1"
"It's basically homebrew.","11:55","11:57",0,"speaker 1"
"But if there's a better way to install it in Linux, I would do that.","11:58","12:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Snap just takes so much memory and it's just a overhead.","12:01","12:05",0,"speaker 1"
"That sucks.","12:05","12:06",0,"speaker 1"
"But let's see how GitHub tells you to donate.","12:06","12:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So GitHub, normally the way you do it and we're just gonna.","12:10","12:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","12:23","12:23",0,"speaker 1"
"By the way, I have it working on my machine.","12:23","12:24",0,"speaker 1"
"In case you're wondering.","12:24","12:25",0,"speaker 1"
"I never use it.","12:26","12:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Although.","12:27","12:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, well, that's because you don't.","12:27","12:29",0,"speaker 1"
"You're on a Mac, so you.","12:29","12:31",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, yeah, you should use actually, but type sudo.","12:31","12:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Sudo.","12:36","12:37",0,"speaker 1"
"That's how you run the root commands and space and you're gonna type apt.","12:37","12:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Apt.","12:43","12:44",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the package manager for Ubuntu.","12:45","12:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So this is how most things you're going to install.","12:49","12:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So type space, install space.","12:52","13:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's try GH enter.","13:01","13:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Can I ask a quick question?","13:07","13:08",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, yeah, sure.","13:09","13:09",0,"speaker 1"
"For some reason, I don't have the dot config file.","13:11","13:14",1,"speaker 2"
"It just has no such file or directory.","13:14","13:16",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay.","13:18","13:19",0,"speaker 1"
"So if you type PWD and press Enter, it should tell your current working directory.","13:19","13:27",0,"speaker 1"
"What does it say?","13:27","13:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Home marquee.","13:28","13:29",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, that's.","13:31","13:32",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what it should be.","13:32","13:34",0,"speaker 1"
"And when you type CD into dot config, you're.","13:34","13:40",0,"speaker 1"
"You're putting.","13:40","13:41",0,"speaker 1"
"You're doing it with the.","13:41","13:42",0,"speaker 1"
"The period in front.","13:42","13:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, exactly how we did it.","13:44","13:46",1,"speaker 2"
"That only worries me because, I mean, you could make that directory, but like, I installed something already, so maybe that's why it.","13:48","13:55",0,"speaker 1"
"It made the folder.","13:55","13:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's.","13:57","13:58",0,"speaker 1"
"That is 100% possible.","13:58","13:59",0,"speaker 1"
"It looks like you installed open code, right?","13:59","14:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","14:02","14:02",0,"speaker 1"
"So great.","14:03","14:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Why don't.","14:05","14:06",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, I know GitHub will install something here, so press type ls.","14:06","14:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Press enter to make sure that I'm right.","14:10","14:12",0,"speaker 1"
"It did not.","14:14","14:14",0,"speaker 1"
"So why don't we install something that we know 100% is going to install something here?","14:15","14:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, the next thing we have to install.","14:23","14:25",0,"speaker 1"
"You can do this and also Malky do it too, even though you don't have the config directory.","14:26","14:35",0,"speaker 1"
"And we're going to see if this creates the dot config just for craziness.","14:35","14:39",0,"speaker 1"
"I just want to see if you're in the same version of Ubuntu.","14:40","14:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you type uname as one like the letter u and then N a, M, e and then space A dash A.","14:43","14:54",0,"speaker 1"
"So you are WSL2.","14:59","15:02",0,"speaker 1"
"It doesn't say Ubuntu here.","15:04","15:06",0,"speaker 1"
"That's okay.","15:08","15:09",0,"speaker 1"
"I think they count the Ubuntu as a distro, which is in another directory.","15:09","15:14",0,"speaker 1"
"But let's just see if.","15:14","15:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Does yours say the same Mauki?","15:15","15:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","15:17","15:17",1,"speaker 2"
"Awesome.","15:18","15:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Then I'm just going to assume it's this install issue.","15:19","15:22",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's.","15:22","15:23",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to paste in.","15:24","15:28",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm going to give you a command and you paste it started install for.","15:28","15:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there a WSL version?","15:37","15:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","15:38","15:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Good.","15:39","15:39",0,"speaker 1"
"AMD 64 copy.","15:43","15:46",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, it's a big block.","15:46","15:47",0,"speaker 1"
"You're going to do it all in one paste.","15:47","15:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Where's my teams?","15:51","15:52",0,"speaker 1"
"And the chat.","15:53","15:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Come on, chat, View notes, apps, people.","15:59","16:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, there we go.","16:05","16:05",0,"speaker 1"
"And this is a shell.","16:12","16:15",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, let me know if you see that block.","16:18","16:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I see it on the screen there.","16:20","16:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","16:26","16:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","16:27","16:28",0,"speaker 1"
"It is Installing something.","16:34","16:35",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, this is installing my as your package manager in Linux.","16:36","16:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So normally, I don't know how many of you have ever used.","16:44","16:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, I mean, if you're on a Mac, you notice too, you need, like to install Python.","16:46","16:50",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't really install python, you install PyCon for.","16:50","16:55",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't even know what it's called.","16:55","16:56",0,"speaker 1"
"And same for Node, you don't install node, you install npm.","16:56","16:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's your package manager.","16:59","17:01",0,"speaker 1"
"And Pip.","17:01","17:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Pip is your package manager for Python.","17:02","17:04",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you have Pipex.","17:05","17:06",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","17:06","17:07",0,"speaker 1"
"They're all different things.","17:07","17:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Mise does all of that and it centralizes it.","17:08","17:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So it doesn't matter what machine you're on or what distro or anything.","17:11","17:14",0,"speaker 1"
"It's the same commands, the same packages, the same everything.","17:14","17:17",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's cool, but I consider it necessary for AI because there's so many different ways to use it and there's so many different clients out there and so many different things that it's too hard to manage it all.","17:18","17:30",0,"speaker 1"
"So as long as we all use my eyes, we can cut and paste each other's commands, prompts, scripts, whatever, and it should all work.","17:31","17:37",0,"speaker 1"
"It doesn't matter what environment you're in.","17:39","17:41",0,"speaker 1"
"If you're in Bash, if you're in whatever.","17:41","17:42",0,"speaker 1"
"If you use mys, it automatically configures which environment you're in and all that stuff.","17:43","17:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So there's a bunch of things.","17:48","17:49",0,"speaker 1"
"That's the quick explanation for what it does.","17:49","17:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, you typed LS and there is nothing there for you.","17:53","17:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Am I right?","18:00","18:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Only open code right now.","18:02","18:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Only open code.","18:04","18:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Why do I see it and you don't?","18:09","18:11",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, not.","18:14","18:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Not worried yet, because nothing's not.","18:15","18:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Nothing's not working.","18:16","18:17",0,"speaker 1"
"It's just.","18:17","18:18",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't.","18:18","18:18",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm not even going to worry about it.","18:18","18:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Probably installing in a different folder or something.","18:19","18:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe, maybe.","18:21","18:22",0,"speaker 1"
"But I. I used to use it.","18:22","18:24",0,"speaker 1"
"I had WSL for years.","18:24","18:25",0,"speaker 1"
"And it.","18:26","18:26",0,"speaker 1"
"I always put it here.","18:26","18:28",0,"speaker 1"
"But maybe.","18:28","18:28",0,"speaker 1"
"What happens if you type gh?","18:28","18:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Does it work?","18:30","18:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, there's gh.","18:34","18:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Good.","18:36","18:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So you're going to need to do GH off login, and you only need to do it once GH A, U, T, H for off and then login.","18:36","18:49",0,"speaker 1"
"So now you want GitHub.com and you want ssh.","18:53","18:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And you don't need to generate.","19:01","19:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you do, because this is considered a new machine.","19:03","19:06",0,"speaker 1"
"So you want to type.","19:06","19:07",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to enter for yes and then no passphrase.","19:07","19:11",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have no passphrase.","19:12","19:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Enter.","19:13","19:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Just press enter.","19:14","19:14",0,"speaker 1"
"And I would type like.","19:16","19:19",0,"speaker 1"
"No, I would type Zvi.","19:21","19:22",0,"speaker 1"
"WSL.","19:23","19:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Just because when you see it in the GitHub, we'll know exactly what it is.","19:26","19:31",0,"speaker 1"
"And now you could log in with a browser, but that's the easiest.","19:31","19:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah.","19:36","19:37",0,"speaker 1"
"But later I'll show you.","19:37","19:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Because this.","19:38","19:39",0,"speaker 1"
"That's only.","19:39","19:40",0,"speaker 1"
"It's annoying because you have to do this occasionally and I hate that.","19:40","19:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, you don't have to save that.","19:46","19:47",0,"speaker 1"
"You just want to go into that browser.","19:47","19:49",0,"speaker 1"
"You have a headless.","19:57","19:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You have a headless.","19:58","19:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's another reason why you don't.","19:59","20:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","20:02","20:02",0,"speaker 1"
"So we want.","20:02","20:03",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to use the key.","20:03","20:05",0,"speaker 1"
"I make one key.","20:06","20:07",0,"speaker 1"
"I use it for everything.","20:07","20:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Ever.","20:08","20:08",0,"speaker 1"
"It did launch the browser.","20:08","20:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Browser.","20:10","20:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back to your.","20:10","20:11",0,"speaker 1"
"You could try it, but go back to your thing and paste that.","20:11","20:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, there you go.","20:15","20:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","20:16","20:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Authorize the callback.","20:16","20:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Might not work.","20:18","20:19",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, now go back and see if it.","20:23","20:25",0,"speaker 1"
"If it recognized.","20:25","20:26",0,"speaker 1"
"That's cool.","20:27","20:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's good.","20:28","20:29",0,"speaker 1"
"So they must be X forwarding.","20:29","20:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's good.","20:32","20:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you're logged in.","20:33","20:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Now let's clone Zishy.","20:34","20:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Zish.","20:35","20:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So we're going to clone it right here in this config directory because it's a config.","20:36","20:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So you're going to type GH Repo.","20:41","20:44",0,"speaker 1"
"GH Space Repo.","20:44","20:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Clone.","20:48","20:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Zsh.","20:51","20:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Zshy.","20:53","20:54",0,"speaker 1"
"No Zshy.","20:56","20:57",0,"speaker 1"
"I never said it aloud before.","20:58","20:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's Zshy.","20:59","21:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Zshai.","21:02","21:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, Zishai's dish.","21:05","21:06",0,"speaker 1"
"No, no.","21:06","21:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Why at the end.","21:07","21:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, this is the name of the shell.","21:08","21:10",0,"speaker 1"
"It's Z Shell.","21:10","21:11",0,"speaker 1"
"It's a very Z. Shelly.","21:12","21:14",0,"speaker 1"
"I love it.","21:15","21:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, okay.","21:16","21:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So the reason that didn't work is because it's trying to clone from your account.","21:17","21:23",0,"speaker 1"
"You need the URL for the whole.","21:23","21:24",0,"speaker 1"
"No, you don't.","21:25","21:25",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what you need to type is inst.","21:25","21:27",0,"speaker 1"
"You need to press up very conveniently.","21:27","21:30",0,"speaker 1"
"And now at the beginning of Zissygysh, you're going to type all caps.","21:31","21:35",0,"speaker 1"
"YIC Triumph.","21:35","21:38",0,"speaker 1"
"And the T is capital.","21:41","21:42",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know why.","21:42","21:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's weird.","21:43","21:44",0,"speaker 1"
"That's case sensitive.","21:44","21:45",0,"speaker 1"
"But Triumph.","21:45","21:48",0,"speaker 1"
"And then it should work.","21:48","21:49",0,"speaker 1"
"This is Triumph's config.","21:49","21:51",0,"speaker 1"
"And say yes, type yes.","21:52","21:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Great.","21:57","21:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now if you ls, you should see Zishy this.","21:58","22:00",0,"speaker 1"
"And this was going to ghoul.","22:02","22:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, there it is.","22:05","22:06",0,"speaker 1"
"You had to use it.","22:06","22:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Interesting.","22:08","22:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","22:08","22:09",0,"speaker 1"
"So now this uses there.","22:09","22:11",0,"speaker 1"
"I think it's empty because I didn't have time to do anything yet.","22:11","22:15",0,"speaker 1"
"But it doesn't matter because I can add stuff to it now.","22:15","22:18",0,"speaker 1"
"And all you have to do is git pull and then you'll get all the stuff I add.","22:19","22:22",0,"speaker 1"
"So this is the key.","22:23","22:24",0,"speaker 1"
"This is more important than anything that you have it here.","22:25","22:27",0,"speaker 1"
"The next important thing, there might be aliases.","22:29","22:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you.","22:31","22:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you go into zishy Zish CD into.","22:31","22:36",0,"speaker 1"
"You could just put the letters in press tab.","22:38","22:40",0,"speaker 1"
"It should catch the whole thing.","22:40","22:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's something that you should learn quick.","22:42","22:44",0,"speaker 1"
"You should never type more than the letters than you need because that takes time.","22:45","22:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So I would type.","22:48","22:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, there, enter.","22:49","22:51",0,"speaker 1"
"And let's see what's in here.","22:52","22:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe nothing.","22:53","22:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't think I have enough time to commit the things I added.","22:54","22:57",0,"speaker 1"
"So LS to see nothing in here.","22:59","23:04",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so I'm going to add the one file that is probably the most important for you guys now.","23:05","23:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, there's two.","23:12","23:12",0,"speaker 1"
"There's secrets and there's aliases.","23:12","23:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So let me add git status, add all, git commit.","23:15","23:22",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm going to add this as the initial commit, initial aliases or something.","23:25","23:34",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll see if you can pull it down.","23:35","23:36",0,"speaker 1"
"And you see how easy this is.","23:36","23:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Git push.","23:39","23:40",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, now do a git pull.","23:42","23:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Great.","23:46","23:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now open up aliases.","23:48","23:49",0,"speaker 1"
"I hope I didn't give you any of my secrets, but actually it doesn't matter.","23:49","23:53",0,"speaker 1"
"So do.","23:53","23:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Now here's the part I didn't think of yet.","23:55","23:57",0,"speaker 1"
"If you guys are not familiar with VI and Vim and all that, you're not going to want to use it.","23:57","24:09",0,"speaker 1"
"You could use Sublime as well, by the way.","24:09","24:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Sublime is awesome.","24:11","24:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Actually, the new Sublime, the new cool thing is called Helix.","24:13","24:16",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what all the cool kids are using these days.","24:16","24:18",0,"speaker 1"
"It's like the successor to Sublime.","24:18","24:20",0,"speaker 1"
"But yeah, you could.","24:22","24:23",0,"speaker 1"
"You're gonna want to do that.","24:24","24:26",0,"speaker 1"
"You're gonna.","24:26","24:27",0,"speaker 1"
"You're gonna want to have a shortcut in your Linux where you can type like sub and then the file.","24:27","24:33",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","24:33","24:34",0,"speaker 1"
"It make.","24:35","24:36",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean if you don't, it's gonna.","24:36","24:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","24:37","24:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you type sub?","24:38","24:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So, okay, you need the path for Sublime.","24:45","24:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you tell in Windows what path Sublime is installed?","24:47","24:50",0,"speaker 1"
"This is a fun.","24:55","24:56",0,"speaker 1"
"A fun pop quiz for you, Windows.","24:56","24:57",0,"speaker 1"
"By the way.","24:57","24:57",0,"speaker 1"
"You could put this in.","24:57","24:58",0,"speaker 1"
"There's Instead of open with vi, I'll tell you the command open.","24:58","25:06",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","25:17","25:18",0,"speaker 1"
"What are you telling me?","25:18","25:19",0,"speaker 1"
"How open was what?","25:19","25:20",0,"speaker 1"
"You could just do sub L S U B L and put in the file name and then I'll just open it with Sublime.","25:20","25:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, that, I mean, that's what we're doing.","25:26","25:29",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what I meant.","25:29","25:30",0,"speaker 1"
"I, I.","25:30","25:31",0,"speaker 1"
"When I said sub, I guess I said it wrong.","25:31","25:32",0,"speaker 1"
"You're right, it's sub O.","25:32","25:33",0,"speaker 1"
"But you have.","25:34","25:35",0,"speaker 1"
"If you've Sublime already installed.","25:35","25:37",0,"speaker 1"
"I always forget it myself, by the way.","25:37","25:39",0,"speaker 1"
"But it won't because the miss.","25:39","25:41",0,"speaker 1"
"This is a new machine and he never installed it, you know.","25:41","25:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh yeah, you're right.","25:43","25:45",0,"speaker 1"
"You're right.","25:45","25:45",0,"speaker 1"
"So he's right.","25:45","25:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now he's going to look up right here.","25:46","25:49",0,"speaker 1"
"That's awesome.","25:49","25:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Now copy that.","25:50","25:50",0,"speaker 1"
"And now here's what you're going to type.","25:52","25:55",0,"speaker 1"
"You are going to type.","25:56","25:57",0,"speaker 1"
"You are going to type echo.","26:01","26:04",0,"speaker 1"
"And you won't have to do this after you have Sublime.","26:07","26:09",0,"speaker 1"
"It's just because you don't have an editor.","26:09","26:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Echo quote, alias.","26:11","26:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Gotta do that.","26:19","26:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Alias.","26:22","26:22",0,"speaker 1"
"What's alias?","26:23","26:24",0,"speaker 1"
"L I A S. No, alias.","26:25","26:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Literally spell it like the dumb show on tv.","26:28","26:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Alias.","26:31","26:31",0,"speaker 1"
"S U B L. S U B L. Yeah, I'm so lazy.","26:33","26:38",0,"speaker 1"
"I'd probably call it S because I would use it so much.","26:38","26:41",0,"speaker 1"
"But you might.","26:41","26:42",0,"speaker 1"
"You can do that later.","26:42","26:43",0,"speaker 1"
"So subl Equals like that.","26:43","26:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","26:47","26:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Equals.","26:47","26:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","26:50","26:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Now single quote.","26:50","26:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","26:53","26:54",0,"speaker 1"
"And now paste that.","26:54","26:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Now I don't think that.","26:55","26:58",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's not going to work because that is.","26:58","27:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Linux doesn't understand those.","27:04","27:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Those slashes.","27:05","27:06",0,"speaker 1"
"So you're going to have to invert, make the outer quotes, make them single and make the inner ones quotes.","27:07","27:16",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","27:16","27:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Because it.","27:16","27:17",0,"speaker 1"
"In this case, we need it to resolve the spaces and all that.","27:17","27:21",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase the double quote and make it a single.","27:21","27:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Mm.","27:28","27:28",0,"speaker 1"
"And erase that single, make it a double and so on.","27:28","27:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that single, make it a double and then end with a single.","27:33","27:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Now.","27:39","27:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry, I have to jump off.","27:40","27:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Please continue.","27:42","27:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Unfortunately, come back if it ends early or if maybe.","27:43","27:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it's canceled because they're sick.","27:48","27:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Be nice, okay?","27:50","27:52",0,"speaker 1"
"No, not be nice if they're sick.","27:52","27:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Be nice if I come back, okay?","27:53","27:55",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll talk.","27:55","27:55",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, take care.","27:56","27:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, is it still being recorded?","27:58","28:00",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm gonna record just in case it is recording.","28:00","28:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, me.","28:03","28:04",0,"speaker 1"
"He went off.","28:04","28:05",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm going to record because this is good material so far.","28:05","28:09",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm so excited.","28:12","28:13",0,"speaker 1"
"This is going to make us so more all on the same page and better.","28:13","28:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Faster.","28:18","28:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Start recording.","28:19","28:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","28:20","28:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Now what we need to do is make sure that your mount.","28:21","28:26",0,"speaker 1"
"You have a mount drive.","28:28","28:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Like for instance, C colon, I don't think makes sense in this.","28:31","28:34",0,"speaker 1"
"So press Enter.","28:34","28:37",0,"speaker 1"
"It's going to echo it.","28:37","28:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So what?","28:38","28:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Press Enter.","28:39","28:39",0,"speaker 1"
"It should echo it.","28:39","28:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Now let's see if it exists.","28:40","28:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Type LS space.","28:43","28:50",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to, we're going to have it list something else.","28:50","28:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So type slash for the root directory, backslash forces forward.","28:52","28:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And now type mnt for mount M n T and enter.","29:01","29:07",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","29:09","29:09",0,"speaker 1"
"So there's your C drive.","29:09","29:10",0,"speaker 1"
"You see this little C. So if you ever want, like this is good to know.","29:10","29:16",0,"speaker 1"
"If you're in here and you want to edit a file that's in your Windows, that's how you do it.","29:16","29:22",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's awesome.","29:22","29:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Like that's.","29:23","29:23",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't understand how magical that is that it automatically mounts to.","29:23","29:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Because now you can do Linux y things with your Windows stuff and vice versa.","29:26","29:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Very, very cool.","29:31","29:32",0,"speaker 1"
"So press.","29:32","29:35",0,"speaker 1"
"We're gonna, we're gonna make sure that we can find that exact folder that.","29:35","29:39",0,"speaker 1"
"That program.","29:39","29:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So press up and now press.","29:40","29:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, go down to that.","29:44","29:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press tab.","29:46","29:47",0,"speaker 1"
"It should have a slash after it.","29:47","29:49",0,"speaker 1"
"So if you press tab there.","29:49","29:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Now tab twice should autocomplete.","29:50","29:53",0,"speaker 1"
"So there.","29:56","29:56",0,"speaker 1"
"See how you do Tab twice.","29:56","29:58",0,"speaker 1"
"And now we can see our options.","29:58","29:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So now type C and then tab twice.","30:00","30:07",0,"speaker 1"
"And now we're looking for program data.","30:09","30:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So type.","30:11","30:12",0,"speaker 1"
"It's case sensitive.","30:12","30:14",0,"speaker 1"
"So pro.","30:14","30:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Just type Capital PR and then tab.","30:15","30:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Just tab.","30:21","30:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","30:22","30:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, there's more than one, so you're gonna want.","30:22","30:29",0,"speaker 1"
"If you tab twice again, what happens?","30:30","30:32",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what?","30:35","30:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so see that should 100% like.","30:36","30:39",0,"speaker 1"
"It should go to a little selector to let you select it.","30:39","30:42",0,"speaker 1"
"That's because you're in.","30:42","30:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Not a cool.","30:45","30:46",0,"speaker 1"
"You're not a good terminal emulator.","30:46","30:49",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know what this is, but we'll deal with that later.","30:49","30:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So for now you're going to have to type backslash space and then tab and.","30:53","31:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh wait, no, you want program data.","31:08","31:10",0,"speaker 1"
"What am I thinking?","31:10","31:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So go back and erase that slash.","31:11","31:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Press capital D tab slash.","31:13","31:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","31:18","31:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Microsoft tab and then Windows tab.","31:20","31:27",0,"speaker 1"
"It might autocorrect.","31:32","31:34",0,"speaker 1"
"It might autocorrect the W as being uppercase.","31:34","31:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, maybe if this isn't a good terminal, it won't not.","31:36","31:41",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not tabbing over here.","31:41","31:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Tab right there.","31:45","31:46",0,"speaker 1"
"It won't even.","31:48","31:49",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","31:49","31:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","31:50","31:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, that's why it's not, because there's more options.","31:53","31:56",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's Sneaky.","31:57","31:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","31:58","31:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now W tab.","31:58","32:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's see if it can get the lowercase W and if it's smart enough, just for future reference, W, do a lowercase W and then press tab.","32:00","32:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Nothing.","32:12","32:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Press it twice.","32:13","32:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Windows.","32:18","32:19",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's not smart enough to understand that there's a capital W. So erase that and make it capital W. And now Tab.","32:19","32:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","32:29","32:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Double tab.","32:30","32:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, yeah.","32:33","32:35",0,"speaker 1"
"I usually I spam tab because it's just.","32:35","32:38",0,"speaker 1"
"It's the most optimal algorithm.","32:38","32:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So I go like, W tab, like.","32:40","32:43",0,"speaker 1"
"And then, you know, that's just what I do.","32:43","32:45",0,"speaker 1"
"So you'll get used to it.","32:45","32:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So then Windows, type.","32:47","32:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Just finish that up.","32:48","32:49",0,"speaker 1"
"And then Windows, what comes after that?","32:52","32:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Start menu.","32:58","32:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So start with a capital s again.","32:59","33:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, ST would have done it.","33:05","33:07",0,"speaker 1"
"I usually type 2 or 3 because then the odds are statistically higher it's going to complete.","33:07","33:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So now Sublime.","33:14","33:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, in programs.","33:15","33:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So capital P. Oh, press up and then just capital P tab.","33:16","33:23",0,"speaker 1"
"And now Sublime should be in here.","33:24","33:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, a lot of programs.","33:29","33:30",0,"speaker 1"
"These are where all your programs are.","33:30","33:31",0,"speaker 1"
"What do you see?","33:33","33:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Sublime.","33:33","33:34",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't even see sublime.","33:35","33:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Sublime text 3.","33:37","33:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Is that really what will work?","33:41","33:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, we could try it.","33:45","33:46",0,"speaker 1"
"So just type Sublime.","33:46","33:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I guess that's what it is.","33:51","33:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Also funny to tell you now, but typing this whole thing out there is an extension.","33:55","33:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Not extension like in the terminal.","33:59","34:02",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, the explorer that you're just looking, you might be able to right click copy as WSL and it will copy the path like this, convert it between the two for future reference.","34:02","34:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, here.","34:14","34:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Sublime.","34:15","34:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","34:16","34:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So tab that out.","34:17","34:18",0,"speaker 1"
"And now if you press home, where the home key is, get all the way back to the beginning of this huge thing.","34:18","34:25",0,"speaker 1"
"What's going on here?","34:26","34:27",0,"speaker 1"
"So press up and first of all, put that whole thing in quotes.","34:30","34:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Not the ls.","34:37","34:37",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't want the ls.","34:37","34:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So you're going to want to press.","34:38","34:40",0,"speaker 1"
"And you're.","34:41","34:41",0,"speaker 1"
"And you remember the.","34:41","34:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Put them in double quotes.","34:44","34:46",0,"speaker 1"
"So from.","34:47","34:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","34:47","34:48",0,"speaker 1"
"And erase the LS while you're here, while the cursor is there.","34:48","34:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, we're just going to build the command again, but from here.","34:51","34:57",0,"speaker 1"
"That wasn't what I was trying to do.","34:58","34:59",0,"speaker 1"
"There we go.","35:03","35:04",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase that.","35:04","35:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Now type here.","35:05","35:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you can put an end quote there.","35:08","35:10",0,"speaker 1"
"And so there's going to be some more in.","35:10","35:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Like you're going to type now and then at the beginning.","35:15","35:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's just type now.","35:17","35:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So this.","35:18","35:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you want to type the greater than or less than.","35:20","35:25",0,"speaker 1"
"It's the little arrow pointing to the right twice.","35:25","35:28",0,"speaker 1"
"So two of Them.","35:29","35:30",0,"speaker 1"
"One of them makes means it will overwrite the file.","35:30","35:34",0,"speaker 1"
"That.","35:34","35:35",0,"speaker 1"
"This is called a.","35:35","35:36",0,"speaker 1"
"You know, this is.","35:36","35:37",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not called a pipe, but I call it piping.","35:38","35:40",0,"speaker 1"
"It's a concat thing, basically.","35:42","35:44",0,"speaker 1"
"So when you have two of them, it'll append instead of overwrite.","35:45","35:48",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's what we want.","35:48","35:49",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't want to erase our aliases, we just want to add one more to the very bottom.","35:49","35:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's what this will do.","35:52","35:54",0,"speaker 1"
"And type space.","35:54","35:55",0,"speaker 1"
"And we're going to tell it where our alias file is.","35:55","35:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Which is.","35:58","35:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Which directory are you in?","36:01","36:03",0,"speaker 1"
"You're in this.","36:03","36:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Use this show.","36:03","36:04",0,"speaker 1"
"You're going to type a L tab.","36:04","36:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, no.","36:10","36:10",0,"speaker 1"
"You know, that's not even going to work because there's two alias files in here.","36:10","36:13",0,"speaker 1"
"So aliases just es, sh or.","36:13","36:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, A, al.","36:18","36:20",0,"speaker 1"
"No, it's aliases.","36:20","36:22",0,"speaker 1"
"And then tab.","36:23","36:24",0,"speaker 1"
"It'll complete it.","36:24","36:25",0,"speaker 1"
"There, that's it.","36:25","36:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So don't press enter.","36:25","36:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go all the way to the beginning.","36:28","36:30",0,"speaker 1"
"You're going to add the echo part.","36:30","36:32",0,"speaker 1"
"So type echo space, single quote, alias space, S, U, B, L and then equals.","36:37","36:54",0,"speaker 1"
"And then get rid of the spaces because the spaces will break shells like that.","36:55","37:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, and the other space too, next to the sub.","37:02","37:04",0,"speaker 1"
"And don't forget the end.","37:05","37:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Oops.","37:09","37:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, wait a minute.","37:10","37:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Did you press enter?","37:12","37:13",0,"speaker 1"
"No, I pressed down.","37:13","37:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, all right.","37:15","37:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Because.","37:17","37:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, all right.","37:17","37:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So you want the end single quote and it should come after the double quote.","37:18","37:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, nope, yeah, that's wrong.","37:26","37:28",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't want to include the aliases.","37:29","37:32",0,"speaker 1"
"You just want to.","37:33","37:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, wait, yeah, you don't erase the.","37:34","37:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that too.","37:38","37:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, the quotes are only for the alias itself.","37:41","37:45",0,"speaker 1"
"And the thing.","37:45","37:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Basically what this says is print out that entire thing, alias, sublah and then add it to the end of aliases.","37:47","37:57",0,"speaker 1"
"That's basically what it does.","37:57","37:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press enter.","37:58","37:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, when you open a new shell, well, you need to actually source or execute the aliases, which automatically happens when you open a terminal.","38:02","38:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So from now on you never have to do this.","38:16","38:17",0,"speaker 1"
"But for now, just run source, S O, U R, C E space, tilde for your home directory, slash, dot, zsh, rc, enter.","38:17","38:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but.","38:46","38:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but that's what I thought.","38:48","38:50",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have zish yet, so you need.","38:50","38:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Everyone needs to do this.","38:54","38:56",0,"speaker 1"
"You need to install zish.","38:56","38:58",0,"speaker 1"
"That's why all the.","38:58","38:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Remember all those things that weren't working that they should have.","38:59","39:02",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have the right shell.","39:02","39:04",0,"speaker 1"
"So I'll give you.","39:04","39:06",0,"speaker 1"
"It's super easy.","39:06","39:06",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have to worry.","39:06","39:07",0,"speaker 1"
"So first type sudo space apt says install space zsh there enter and then.","39:07","39:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes, and I'll give you one more thing to.","39:35","39:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh my.","39:46","39:47",0,"speaker 1"
"This.","39:48","39:48",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll give you one more command to type in and it is.","39:49","39:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, super easy.","39:56","39:57",0,"speaker 1"
"And I'll paste it in our teams.","39:59","40:01",0,"speaker 1"
"And Malky, you're still with us.","40:01","40:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Everyone.","40:03","40:03",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know how many people I'm here.","40:04","40:07",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","40:07","40:08",0,"speaker 1"
"I just want to make sure that you're not like.","40:08","40:10",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't want to like me making people.","40:10","40:11",0,"speaker 1"
"If, like, if I need to go slower, just let me know.","40:11","40:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, actually I've been lost on the part of having the configuration.","40:15","40:21",1,"speaker 2"
"I still don't have that.","40:22","40:23",1,"speaker 2"
"But that's okay.","40:23","40:24",1,"speaker 2"
"We can solve TCB first and then.","40:24","40:27",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, yeah, but we should look at that because that's a core thing.","40:28","40:32",0,"speaker 1"
"So we should.","40:32","40:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","40:32","40:33",1,"speaker 2"
"Yes.","40:35","40:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So this will automatically change your default shell.","40:36","40:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So yes, put in your password.","40:39","40:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you're going to have colors and it.","40:44","40:47",0,"speaker 1"
"This is just.","40:47","40:48",0,"speaker 1"
"If you use this and you don't have this, you're not cool.","40:49","40:51",0,"speaker 1"
"And you need it because it's better now you'll have a lot of extra info.","40:51","40:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You'll see which directory you're in.","40:58","41:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You'll see if it's a git repository, which branch you're in.","41:00","41:02",0,"speaker 1"
"That's part of what this does.","41:03","41:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Zishy zish is a custom override for zish and oh my zish.","41:06","41:11",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't need to know any of that.","41:11","41:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So now that you did that, your aliases now press up until you get to that source.","41:12","41:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Don't have no more ups because it's an erase the history.","41:22","41:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","41:25","41:25",0,"speaker 1"
"That's fine.","41:25","41:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we can type source and we're going to manually source all those aliases.","41:27","41:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So press space and dot config slash.","41:39","41:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Zishy Zish.","41:47","41:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, no zishy.","41:54","41:56",0,"speaker 1"
"One of the aliases is a.","41:58","42:01",0,"speaker 1"
"You never have to type it again.","42:01","42:02",0,"speaker 1"
"So don't worry about it.","42:02","42:03",0,"speaker 1"
"It's I make it ZC now.","42:03","42:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Slash.","42:07","42:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, don't source that.","42:08","42:09",0,"speaker 1"
"You want another slash and you want aliases and then tab.","42:09","42:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So aliases tab.","42:13","42:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, type.zsh.","42:18","42:23",0,"speaker 1"
"i don't know why it won't complete dot zsh.","42:23","42:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, try it.","42:28","42:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, let's try it.","42:33","42:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry.","42:36","42:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, oh, oh.","42:39","42:40",0,"speaker 1"
"You're in this.","42:40","42:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Use this.","42:40","42:41",0,"speaker 1"
"I thought when it made a new shell that it took you to home, but even easier.","42:41","42:45",0,"speaker 1"
"So just type dot.","42:45","42:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Dot is a shortcut for source.","42:46","42:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So you can say dot space.","42:49","42:50",0,"speaker 1"
"And I didn't know that for 45 years.","42:51","42:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm 45.","42:54","42:55",0,"speaker 1"
"And I've been.","42:55","42:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I didn't know dot is a shortcut, but it is so dot.","42:56","42:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now aliases.","42:59","43:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Zsh.","43:01","43:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","43:04","43:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, here's when you type, when you want to access a file in your current directory, you need to have a dot slash in the front.","43:06","43:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Because when you do ali, it could mean your folder, but it also could be any program in your path that starts with an A.","43:16","43:26",0,"speaker 1"
"So, nope, erase that slash because dot means source.","43:27","43:32",0,"speaker 1"
"And now for there, if we do means current directory, go like this.","43:32","43:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, it's going to look really weird.","43:41","43:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Press back.","43:43","43:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Now space, dot slash again, press the space.","43:44","43:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Like that.","43:51","43:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","43:52","43:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Then go to the end and tab there.","43:53","43:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Now etab.","43:57","43:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press enter.","44:01","44:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, it worked.","44:05","44:06",0,"speaker 1"
"But if you open my aliases file, it's filled with my aliases and it's not going to work yet because you didn't install all the things that I had.","44:08","44:18",0,"speaker 1"
"I made a thing called git search everything.","44:18","44:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh.","44:21","44:21",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, it's just saying there's an error on that file.","44:21","44:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","44:24","44:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So do this.","44:25","44:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Tail type, tail aliases, dot slash, aliases.","44:28","44:36",0,"speaker 1"
"And that means print the last few lines you need.","44:44","44:49",0,"speaker 1"
"You need the tab at the end there.","44:49","44:53",0,"speaker 1"
"See, the one that you added is at the bottom.","44:53","44:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Just copy.","44:56","44:57",0,"speaker 1"
"And you want to copy it.","44:57","44:58",0,"speaker 1"
"And we're going to just paste it.","44:58","44:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So copy that.","45:04","45:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Paste it, run it.","45:05","45:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","45:06","45:07",0,"speaker 1"
"So now you can type subl aliases dot slash aliases exec format error.","45:07","45:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Why didn't it run that?","45:37","45:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Is it because there are still spaces?","45:39","45:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you want me to see if I can get that path?","45:43","45:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, right click on that and see if it says copy as wsl.","45:51","45:55",0,"speaker 1"
"See where it says copy as path.","45:57","45:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Does it let you pick what kind?","46:00","46:02",0,"speaker 1"
"So go to show more options.","46:03","46:05",0,"speaker 1"
"It's definitely going to be hidden in the.","46:05","46:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Show more options if it's there.","46:07","46:08",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, now let me just look carefully.","46:09","46:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Edit with vim pin to start property windows.","46:11","46:32",0,"speaker 1"
"I can just copy as path.","46:33","46:36",0,"speaker 1"
"I can just wait.","46:37","46:40",0,"speaker 1"
"This is important, though, because you're going to do this probably a lot.","46:40","46:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, here is answer that they give the WSL path command.","46:44","46:52",0,"speaker 1"
"It converts one path to another.","46:52","46:54",0,"speaker 1"
"So copy that path that you see in.","46:55","47:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, copy the path.","47:08","47:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, you're going to ask it to.","47:11","47:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, you could.","47:12","47:13",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm working towards the first AI thing I'm going to install, which is going to be the.","47:13","47:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Wow.","47:18","47:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we don't have to do anything more else because then I'm going to show you how we're going to use the AI to do everything else in your terminal that's why I'm not worried about.","47:19","47:28",0,"speaker 1"
"If you understand, it doesn't really matter anymore.","47:29","47:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have it in opt.","47:35","47:36",0,"speaker 1"
"What is it talking about?","47:37","47:37",0,"speaker 1"
"We go back to also.","47:37","47:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Also, you'll learn that chat GBT sucks.","47:39","47:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Even the.","47:42","47:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Even the fifth one.","47:43","47:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Hold on.","47:44","47:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Where is subl.","47:46","47:47",0,"speaker 1"
"How to find.","47:47","47:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's not.","47:47","47:48",0,"speaker 1"
"That's not accurate.","47:49","47:51",0,"speaker 1"
"You can ask the question better.","47:55","47:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't even know how to do it in ChatGPT because it's not smart enough.","47:58","48:02",0,"speaker 1"
"But here, let me ask it to Claude.","48:02","48:05",0,"speaker 1"
"I bet.","48:05","48:06",0,"speaker 1"
"What did you say different?","48:16","48:17",0,"speaker 1"
"I said I have the awsl.","48:17","48:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","48:20","48:21",0,"speaker 1"
"So it says Mount C program files, Sublime text.","48:21","48:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Well.","48:26","48:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, oh, you might have forgot that.","48:27","48:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, that's the thing.","48:29","48:30",0,"speaker 1"
"There is no exe.","48:30","48:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You had the LNK file, so you had the wrong pass.","48:31","48:36",0,"speaker 1"
"That's probably wrong.","48:41","48:42",0,"speaker 1"
"And you don't need that BASHRC thing because we're not using bash anymore.","48:42","48:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","48:45","48:45",0,"speaker 1"
"But.","48:46","48:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, yeah, you're in the start menu.","48:47","48:49",0,"speaker 1"
"That's.","48:49","48:49",0,"speaker 1"
"That should have been my red flag.","48:50","48:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Don't you want.","48:52","48:52",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't want to do that.","48:52","48:53",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm not doing it yet.","48:55","48:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, okay.","48:56","48:57",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to.","48:57","48:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","48:59","48:59",0,"speaker 1"
"As soon as we get this subtle, it'll be a lot easier because this is like the chicken and the egg problem.","48:59","49:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, we're struggling with typing it in here to get the editor working.","49:05","49:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Alias Sublime text.","49:14","49:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","49:19","49:20",0,"speaker 1"
"So that would be ZishRC.","49:20","49:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's put it in there.","49:25","49:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Because our custom isn't configured yet, so we might as well put.","49:26","49:30",0,"speaker 1"
"This is like a core.","49:30","49:31",0,"speaker 1"
"We need an editor kind of thing.","49:31","49:33",0,"speaker 1"
"That's good.","49:34","49:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","49:36","49:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","49:38","49:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Now it's.","49:39","49:40",0,"speaker 1"
"No, it won't work until you source it, so you're gonna have to do.","49:41","49:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, what did you just do?","49:46","49:47",0,"speaker 1"
"It just did the tail.","49:49","49:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but the tail.","49:51","49:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you want to tail zishrc, not the aliases.","49:52","49:55",0,"speaker 1"
"No, it's got to be Tilde, because instead of dot slash, it's tilde slash.","50:05","50:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","50:14","50:14",0,"speaker 1"
"So tilde slash means my home directory, and dot slash means my current.","50:14","50:18",0,"speaker 1"
"And you don't want repos.","50:19","50:21",0,"speaker 1"
"You want.","50:21","50:21",0,"speaker 1"
"It's dot slash, dot.","50:22","50:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","50:24","50:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Tilde slash.","50:25","50:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","50:26","50:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Dot IT won't autocomplete.","50:26","50:28",0,"speaker 1"
"The dot files are hidden.","50:28","50:30",0,"speaker 1"
"So you want to do.","50:30","50:31",0,"speaker 1"
"And then zish tab and you want the RC1.","50:32","50:39",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, now.","50:43","50:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I love how you're getting a sense of how much everything sucks before you use my alias file.","50:44","50:51",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you'll see why we make Alice's.","50:51","50:54",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","50:54","50:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","50:56","50:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, this is perfect.","50:56","50:57",0,"speaker 1"
"So now you're going to.","50:57","50:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, yeah, that's all you're doing is checking.","50:59","51:01",0,"speaker 1"
"That looks right.","51:01","51:02",0,"speaker 1"
"So now if you source that file.","51:03","51:06",0,"speaker 1"
"So dot, space, dot, slash.","51:06","51:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, no.","51:09","51:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Dot.","51:10","51:10",0,"speaker 1"
"No, not.","51:10","51:11",0,"speaker 1"
"You didn't.","51:11","51:11",0,"speaker 1"
"You're still in.","51:11","51:12",0,"speaker 1"
"You need tilde slash because you're not in the home directory.","51:12","51:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So dot, space, tilde, slash, dot, zishrc.","51:15","51:20",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","51:25","51:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Do that.","51:26","51:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you can type subtle.","51:28","51:30",0,"speaker 1"
"So type subtle space.","51:30","51:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Whoops.","51:33","51:33",0,"speaker 1"
"It opened this up for me.","51:35","51:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's good.","51:37","51:38",0,"speaker 1"
"That means it's linked.","51:38","51:39",0,"speaker 1"
"But that's just close.","51:39","51:43",0,"speaker 1"
"That close.","51:43","51:43",0,"speaker 1"
"That you don't want this.","51:43","51:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back to your thing.","51:45","51:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now type and now dot or not dot alias.","51:46","51:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you need to dot.","51:52","51:53",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't.","51:53","51:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, you didn't.","51:57","51:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","51:58","51:58",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, awesome.","52:00","52:03",0,"speaker 1"
"So this is personalized to me so you probably can erase a lot.","52:03","52:07",0,"speaker 1"
"I was going to go and make.","52:07","52:08",0,"speaker 1"
"That's another thing I'm going to do.","52:08","52:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Make your.","52:09","52:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Make one for you guys.","52:09","52:10",0,"speaker 1"
"But I'm just going to tell you the important ones and actually this one is wrong.","52:11","52:16",0,"speaker 1"
"That one's wrong.","52:17","52:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase it.","52:18","52:18",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't need it anymore because it's in the zish one.","52:19","52:22",0,"speaker 1"
"You're not going to need Howdy.","52:23","52:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Howdy is like, you know, in Windows, where's Howdy?","52:25","52:29",0,"speaker 1"
"It's the very bottom.","52:29","52:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Howdy is.","52:30","52:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You know how it asks you for your root password all the time?","52:31","52:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Super annoying.","52:34","52:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So Howdy makes it so it'll use your Windows camera to know it's you.","52:35","52:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So you have to type in your password.","52:40","52:42",0,"speaker 1"
"It's just really anything to save time.","52:42","52:44",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't.","52:45","52:46",0,"speaker 1"
"You're gonna just delete a bunch of these.","52:46","52:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So hold shift and you know, I mean delete from.","52:48","52:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, delete.","52:53","52:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep going.","52:55","52:56",0,"speaker 1"

"You want to stop at the erase the alias MSA equals from there down 177 and down.","53:12","53:24",0,"speaker 1"
"You can erase everything after 177.","53:24","53:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, that too.","53:28","53:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","53:28","53:29",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase all that now.","53:30","53:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, wait.","53:32","53:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Undo that.","53:33","53:34",0,"speaker 1"

"It's mine.","53:44","53:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Whatever.","53:48","53:48",0,"speaker 1"
"No, just kind of remind me to tell you to do it.","53:50","53:52",0,"speaker 1"
"You could put a.","53:52","53:53",0,"speaker 1"
"You could put a pound to comment out this line just to remind me to tell you guys.","53:53","53:58",0,"speaker 1"
"It was just.","53:58","53:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, because we can't commit our EMVs, but they're starting to get crazy.","54:01","54:04",0,"speaker 1"
"I made a gist and that command will just synchronize it.","54:05","54:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase again up to that 177.","54:10","54:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","54:15","54:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Now scroll up.","54:16","54:17",0,"speaker 1"
"These are all of the GPT aliases, which are amazing.","54:17","54:20",0,"speaker 1"
"These work.","54:23","54:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Tree things are good.","54:24","54:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","54:25","54:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So we're getting into generic things.","54:25","54:26",0,"speaker 1"
"So go all the way to the top.","54:26","54:27",0,"speaker 1"

"I have code in there.","54:43","54:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe I'll change it.","54:44","54:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll change it to.","54:45","54:46",0,"speaker 1"
"All we need to do is have a root one called code path and everyone could set their own whatever they want.","54:48","54:54",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","54:54","54:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","55:00","55:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's actually change it so we can keep whatever the changes we make.","55:04","55:07",0,"speaker 1"
"I'd like to commit it because remember, this is going to be our repository.","55:07","55:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","55:11","55:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So at the very top above, try note stuff like I should make another line here.","55:12","55:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, make another line and say export.","55:22","55:32",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to.","55:32","55:32",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll call it repo Root.","55:32","55:36",0,"speaker 1"
"You know, like all caps repo, either path or root.","55:37","55:44",0,"speaker 1"
"What do you.","55:44","55:44",0,"speaker 1"
"What do you like better?","55:44","55:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Repo path.","55:47","55:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Repo root.","55:48","55:49",0,"speaker 1"
"It's just going to be the root for where we store all of our repositories.","55:49","55:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Like that Repo path.","55:53","55:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that works.","55:57","55:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now equals.","55:58","55:58",0,"speaker 1"
"And this will be for you, home reposition.","55:59","56:12",0,"speaker 1"
"And if everyone's following along, it'll be the same for them too.","56:13","56:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","56:22","56:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Change the home and down there.","56:23","56:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, exactly.","56:25","56:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Change that to Repo path.","56:25","56:27",0,"speaker 1"
"So dollar sign Repo path.","56:27","56:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Awesome.","56:34","56:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So that will work.","56:35","56:36",0,"speaker 1"
"And now that's relative to that.","56:36","56:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So we can just refer to a repo path and then triumph.","56:38","56:42",0,"speaker 1"
"And you see how this works.","56:42","56:44",0,"speaker 1"
"We could have a triumph route.","56:45","56:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So we don't know that.","56:48","56:49",0,"speaker 1"
"And then because Triumph is not a repo.","56:49","56:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","56:56","56:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Triumph is going to be a work tree sandbox, which I'll show you later.","56:56","57:02",0,"speaker 1"
"But basically, remember Zvi, were having that problem.","57:02","57:05",0,"speaker 1"
"You're like, I don't know how to work on the same repo.","57:05","57:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, how do I have three agents all working on the same repo?","57:08","57:12",0,"speaker 1"
"The trick is you don't have your repo.","57:12","57:16",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's it.","57:16","57:16",0,"speaker 1"
"You have a sandbox that is named after your repository, like Triumph.","57:16","57:21",0,"speaker 1"
"And your repo is called like Trinote 2.0.","57:23","57:27",0,"speaker 1"
"And then inside Trino 2.0, you have the branches.","57:28","57:32",0,"speaker 1"
"You'll have all these work trees.","57:32","57:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you'll have main.","57:34","57:35",0,"speaker 1"
"You'll have the one you're working on, you'll have whatever.","57:35","57:37",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's how we can make this workable and not be annoying by having these exports.","57:38","57:43",0,"speaker 1"
"So we can just name it.","57:43","57:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Anyway, that's what this is for.","57:44","57:46",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's default username, default password.","57:46","57:49",0,"speaker 1"
"These are just handy.","57:49","57:50",0,"speaker 1"
"You might not even need them.","57:50","57:52",0,"speaker 1"
"But I.","57:52","57:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Sometimes I like to refer.","57:53","57:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I get tired of just typing it all out and I just put.","57:55","57:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, so but we're not going to be able to keep this in here because this is personalized and this is a repo thing.","57:57","58:06",0,"speaker 1"
"So just erase this whole block.","58:06","58:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","58:13","58:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Now VI equals nvim.","58:13","58:15",0,"speaker 1"
"We're keeping that sack Docker compose Olama doesn't hurt anything.","58:15","58:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Zzz.","58:23","58:24",0,"speaker 1"
"This is amazing.","58:24","58:26",0,"speaker 1"
"But right there where it says zzz.","58:27","58:29",0,"speaker 1"
"I want you to erase vi the word vi because I love vi.","58:31","58:36",0,"speaker 1"
"You like subl.","58:37","58:38",0,"speaker 1"
"But there is in zish.","58:39","58:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","58:41","58:42",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to use editor.","58:42","58:43",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to set default editor because that way it'll open up whatever you like and we can commit it and it'll still remember.","58:43","58:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So type editor all caps.","58:50","58:52",0,"speaker 1"
"That should work.","58:56","58:57",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll come back to that when we go and set our editors.","58:57","59:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, nope.","59:05","59:05",0,"speaker 1"
"It's already.","59:05","59:06",0,"speaker 1"
"It should be.","59:06","59:07",0,"speaker 1"
"So this editor is going to be defined in our zishrc, which we didn't even look at yet.","59:07","59:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase the big chungus thing.","59:12","59:15",0,"speaker 1"
"That's my computer's.","59:15","59:16",0,"speaker 1"
"That's how I ssh into mine.","59:16","59:18",0,"speaker 1"
"There's that zc.","59:19","59:21",0,"speaker 1"
"We're keeping that will so Z.","59:21","59:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Interesting.","59:29","59:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Where is the export for zc?","59:32","59:34",0,"speaker 1"
"We should add that.","59:40","59:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So go up where those two exports are.","59:42","59:44",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll just add one more.","59:44","59:45",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to export cap ZC equals and it's going to be home or in quotes.","59:47","59:56",0,"speaker 1"
"It'll be $home config zishy zish zsh zs.","59:58","01:00:16",0,"speaker 1"
"No, there's no I.","01:00:16","01:00:17",0,"speaker 1"
"It's implied or no, just it's Z shell.","01:00:17","01:00:21",0,"speaker 1"
"So Z s H. Yep.","01:00:21","01:00:23",0,"speaker 1"
"So now you don't ever have to type that again.","01:00:23","01:00:26",0,"speaker 1"
"You should be doing like cd.","01:00:26","01:00:27",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll show you.","01:00:29","01:00:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Forget that.","01:00:29","01:00:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Don't even.","01:00:30","01:00:30",0,"speaker 1"
"That's not even true.","01:00:31","01:00:32",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't even have to do that.","01:00:32","01:00:33",0,"speaker 1"
"So save that.","01:00:33","01:00:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Go down to go back at where were.","01:00:34","01:00:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Zzz.","01:00:38","01:00:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So when you type.","01:00:41","01:00:42",0,"speaker 1"
"When you type zc, it'll bring you to that directory.","01:00:42","01:00:46",0,"speaker 1"
"It'll CD into zc.","01:00:46","01:00:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Man, it's hard saying that.","01:00:48","01:00:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we're gonna get you up with zellage.","01:00:50","01:00:54",0,"speaker 1"
"But not yet.","01:00:54","01:00:54",0,"speaker 1"
"So leave that.","01:00:54","01:00:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Leave that alacrity.","01:00:55","01:00:58",0,"speaker 1"
"All of this looks good so far.","01:01:00","01:01:02",0,"speaker 1"
"To edit your.","01:01:02","01:01:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Your config, you're going to you type zzz and then to source it instead of having to type dot, space, dot, tilde, slash, you know, all you have to type is zzz or SSS to source and you do it all the time.","01:01:04","01:01:18",0,"speaker 1"
"That's why I made it an alias, because you make a change, you're going to do SSS and it'll reload it.","01:01:18","01:01:22",0,"speaker 1"
"So yeah, let's just leave.","01:01:22","01:01:28",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm going to.","01:01:28","01:01:29",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll change it myself because I know shortcuts to go and replace the vis with editor.","01:01:29","01:01:33",0,"speaker 1"
"But the important one is there.","01:01:33","01:01:35",0,"speaker 1"
"The other one is aaa.","01:01:37","01:01:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Change that VI to editor because you want to edit your aliases all the time.","01:01:39","01:01:45",0,"speaker 1"
"All you got to do to add a new alias is aaa.","01:01:45","01:01:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So editor.","01:01:49","01:01:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, go down secrets.","01:01:49","01:01:54",0,"speaker 1"
"That's another important one.","01:01:54","01:01:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:02:00","01:02:00",0,"speaker 1"
"And I don't see anything else here.","01:02:01","01:02:06",0,"speaker 1"
"That's all good.","01:02:06","01:02:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Now this is Docker related stuff.","01:02:07","01:02:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Go down.","01:02:09","01:02:09",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to see Home Docker.","01:02:09","01:02:12",0,"speaker 1"
"This is all accurate.","01:02:12","01:02:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Do I see any personal things here?","01:02:13","01:02:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes.","01:02:16","01:02:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","01:02:17","01:02:18",0,"speaker 1"
"But it doesn't matter.","01:02:22","01:02:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Just leave it.","01:02:22","01:02:23",0,"speaker 1"
"You might end up adding an AI directory.","01:02:24","01:02:26",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's good traffic code.","01:02:26","01:02:30",0,"speaker 1"
"see I have a export code.","01:02:30","01:02:32",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't need that line anymore because we exported.","01:02:33","01:02:35",0,"speaker 1"
"We call it repo path.","01:02:35","01:02:37",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase that line 50 and actually erase from 50 down to.","01:02:38","01:02:45",0,"speaker 1"
"You can erase the.","01:02:50","01:02:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep going down.","01:02:54","01:02:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase, keep erasing down to erase down to line 58 inclusive right there.","01:02:56","01:03:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","01:03:05","01:03:06",0,"speaker 1"
"MPX that's great.","01:03:06","01:03:07",0,"speaker 1"
"This UV great.","01:03:08","01:03:11",0,"speaker 1"
"This all looks good.","01:03:16","01:03:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Git ignores.","01:03:17","01:03:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:03:18","01:03:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Kill Ollama Taskmaster My.","01:03:20","01:03:23",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","01:03:24","01:03:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Cursor.","01:03:24","01:03:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, you can leave the cursor one because you guys might want to open cursor from Linux without, you know, just like you open subl.","01:03:26","01:03:36",0,"speaker 1"
"We're gonna do the same with Cursor Triprox.","01:03:36","01:03:39",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to change that to your name.","01:03:39","01:03:42",0,"speaker 1"
"And when I give you access, this is how you can to ssh into our AI sandbox machine.","01:03:47","01:03:54",0,"speaker 1"
"On DigitalOcean.","01:03:54","01:03:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I just type triprox My trust.","01:03:56","01:03:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's the same IP all the time.","01:04:00","01:04:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, the Mize Trust.","01:04:02","01:04:05",0,"speaker 1"
"It is so annoying.","01:04:06","01:04:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Every time you go into a new directory with a MYS file, it'll say do you trust this directory?","01:04:07","01:04:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So instead of typing my's trust you type empty.","01:04:12","01:04:15",0,"speaker 1"
"That's whatever.","01:04:16","01:04:17",0,"speaker 1"
"GLOW is a way to view markdown files really nicely in the terminal.","01:04:19","01:04:25",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's so good that I just aliased it to where did I aliase it to G. Oh, to open the readme.","01:04:25","01:04:34",0,"speaker 1"
"So so many times you clone a repo and the first thing you do is you Read the readme.","01:04:34","01:04:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So I just made GR to glow the readme.","01:04:38","01:04:41",0,"speaker 1"
"I never read.","01:04:41","01:04:42",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't read the readmes?","01:04:43","01:04:44",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","01:04:45","01:04:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, maybe it's because it's annoying to type it in now.","01:04:46","01:04:49",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not.","01:04:49","01:04:49",0,"speaker 1"
"It's just because I don't have time.","01:04:50","01:04:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh yeah, well, anything to make it less.","01:04:52","01:04:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so.","01:04:54","01:04:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I read that subtle hint and let's move forward.","01:04:55","01:04:57",0,"speaker 1"
"QQ.","01:04:58","01:04:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You can erase all the QQ's.","01:04:59","01:05:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have Amazon Q. Nope.","01:05:00","01:05:07",0,"speaker 1"
"You keep that P. Yep.","01:05:07","01:05:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that and all the rest there.","01:05:08","01:05:11",0,"speaker 1"
"That's good term log.","01:05:11","01:05:13",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll keep that where I wrote try.","01:05:13","01:05:17",0,"speaker 1"
"That's whenever I log in, I type try.","01:05:18","01:05:20",0,"speaker 1"
"And that brings me right to my try note stuff.","01:05:20","01:05:23",0,"speaker 1"
"You can either modify it to make it make sense for you or just erase it.","01:05:23","01:05:28",0,"speaker 1"
"It's really try note new path.","01:05:33","01:05:35",0,"speaker 1"
"I could even alias for me it's code for you.","01:05:35","01:05:39",0,"speaker 1"
"It's repo path.","01:05:39","01:05:40",0,"speaker 1"
"All caps repo path.","01:05:44","01:05:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:05:48","01:05:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So that should work.","01:05:48","01:05:49",0,"speaker 1"
"And let's just.","01:05:49","01:05:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh good, good.","01:05:52","01:05:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Here's the Claude stuff.","01:05:52","01:05:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Very, very important to have that dangerously skip.","01:05:54","01:05:57",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm glad that I had that.","01:05:57","01:05:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So now let's get out of here.","01:05:59","01:06:01",0,"speaker 1"
"So the way go back to save this.","01:06:02","01:06:04",0,"speaker 1"
"We're gonna want to commit this because all that stuff we did was good.","01:06:04","01:06:07",0,"speaker 1"
"So save it, go back to your Linux and you're gonna do a.","01:06:09","01:06:17",0,"speaker 1"
"You're gonna just going to do git commit space-am for I want to commit everything I changed and then M for message and we're going to type our message in as nope, am is good enough.","01:06:17","01:06:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase the M, put quotes and say generalized aliases just so we know what this commit is and then enter.","01:06:36","01:06:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Everyone's going to have to do this too.","01:06:52","01:06:53",0,"speaker 1"
"The first time you use git in this machine, you're going to have to just type that in.","01:06:53","01:06:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You have to do git config global.","01:06:58","01:07:01",0,"speaker 1"
"It's annoying, but you got to do it.","01:07:01","01:07:04",0,"speaker 1"
"You're just going to type what it says then instead of you example, obviously use that email.","01:07:08","01:07:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Use your do that uses that email.","01:07:21","01:07:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, no, no.","01:07:25","01:07:26",0,"speaker 1"
"This is your yeah, Global user email.","01:07:26","01:07:28",0,"speaker 1"
"That's letting it know what you're going to type next.","01:07:28","01:07:30",0,"speaker 1"
"And now whatever your associated GitHub email is, it's probably your personal one, right?","01:07:30","01:07:36",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not your work.","01:07:36","01:07:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Wonderful.","01:07:44","01:07:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you all know my email.","01:07:45","01:07:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:07:47","01:07:47",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm gonna spam you.","01:07:47","01:07:48",0,"speaker 1"
"I can't wait.","01:07:48","01:07:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, now just erase up to the email and put name.","01:07:49","01:07:51",0,"speaker 1"
"I was really hard to figure out.","01:07:51","01:07:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah.","01:07:53","01:07:54",0,"speaker 1"
"And now we're gonna know your name, so be careful.","01:07:54","01:07:56",0,"speaker 1"

"Well, I think I'm the only one has access because I created it.","01:09:24","01:09:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","01:09:27","01:09:27",0,"speaker 1"
"What I'm just gonna do is I'm gonna use GPT me and I'm gonna say give everyone access.","01:09:28","01:09:34",0,"speaker 1"

"I can't do it because you didn't give me access.","01:09:41","01:09:42",0,"speaker 1"
"But in that repo you go to settings and right here collaborators and team.","01:09:43","01:09:48",0,"speaker 1"
"And you do add people.","01:09:49","01:09:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but you'll learn quickly that it's faster just to ask AI now that we have GPT me.","01:09:51","01:09:56",0,"speaker 1"
"But I got that from a. Oh, you asked it already and it told you that's where to do it?","01:09:57","01:10:04",0,"speaker 1"
"No, I, I did it yesterday.","01:10:04","01:10:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, that makes sense.","01:10:07","01:10:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Then the crypt repo, which I didn't add you because I didn't think you needed it.","01:10:08","01:10:16",0,"speaker 1"
"It's just like a small two file repo.","01:10:17","01:10:21",0,"speaker 1"

"There.","01:12:15","01:12:16",0,"speaker 1"

"It says preferred editor for local and remote sessions.","01:13:34","01:13:38",0,"speaker 1"
"You see that block?","01:13:38","01:13:39",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to uncomment.","01:13:39","01:13:40",0,"speaker 1"

"Yeah, uncomment from there up, up.","01:13:44","01:13:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Only that block the if to phi the shortcuts from there to there.","01:13:47","01:13:55",0,"speaker 1"
"But this is.","01:13:55","01:13:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, this is subtle.","01:13:56","01:13:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't.","01:13:58","01:13:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Can't you.","01:13:59","01:13:59",0,"speaker 1"
"It didn't work.","01:14:00","01:14:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh yeah, there is an uncomment shortcut, but you'd have to probably set it up as a plugin.","01:14:02","01:14:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So change that to whatever you prefer.","01:14:12","01:14:14",0,"speaker 1"
"So for you subl, you want them.","01:14:14","01:14:16",0,"speaker 1"
"You want it for.","01:14:16","01:14:17",0,"speaker 1"
"See, this is for ssh.","01:14:19","01:14:20",0,"speaker 1"
"It won't work.","01:14:23","01:14:24",0,"speaker 1"
"But.","01:14:24","01:14:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So like for instance, if you SSH into triprox or deploy subol is not going to work, but who cares?","01:14:25","01:14:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So I would keep NVIM because that's still.","01:14:31","01:14:35",0,"speaker 1"
"If connection is ssh, just put subl for both.","01:14:37","01:14:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I hated this about Sublime.","01:14:42","01:14:44",0,"speaker 1"
"You just hit cancel and it.","01:14:44","01:14:45",0,"speaker 1"
"And it bugs you every like hour.","01:14:45","01:14:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So what I do now also change NVIM down there to subl.","01:14:50","01:14:57",0,"speaker 1"
"You.","01:14:58","01:14:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You never want nvim.","01:14:58","01:15:00",0,"speaker 1"

"Right now we don't want it.","01:15:05","01:15:06",0,"speaker 1"

"Sss.","01:15:07","01:15:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, sss.","01:15:09","01:15:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Sss.","01:15:10","01:15:11",0,"speaker 1"
"To see.","01:15:11","01:15:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you have to type it a lot.","01:15:12","01:15:13",0,"speaker 1"
"That's why I aliased it.","01:15:13","01:15:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Enter now zzz.","01:15:14","01:15:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, that's right.","01:15:21","01:15:23",0,"speaker 1"
"There's.","01:15:24","01:15:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, there's more stuff we have to edit.","01:15:24","01:15:25",0,"speaker 1"
"We have to tell it the zish custom.","01:15:25","01:15:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Go down.","01:15:27","01:15:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Down.","01:15:27","01:15:27",0,"speaker 1"
"I saw it.","01:15:27","01:15:28",0,"speaker 1"
"I saw it.","01:15:28","01:15:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Right there.","01:15:30","01:15:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Where it says personalize your aliases, all that.","01:15:30","01:15:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase the.","01:15:35","01:15:36",0,"speaker 1"

"Yep.","01:16:00","01:16:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep looking because I just don't see where they're setting it.","01:16:01","01:16:03",0,"speaker 1"

"Next.","01:16:06","01:16:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Next.","01:16:06","01:16:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, there, see, look.","01:16:07","01:16:08",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","01:16:08","01:16:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so uncomment that and you're going to erase that whole thing, the path and you're going to put home dot config slash this usage home.","01:16:09","01:16:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Like that.","01:16:25","01:16:25",0,"speaker 1"
"No, erase the slash.","01:16:26","01:16:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:16:29","01:16:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:16:30","01:16:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","01:16:30","01:16:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Dollar home.","01:16:31","01:16:31",0,"speaker 1"
"There we go.","01:16:33","01:16:34",0,"speaker 1"

"Now it should automatically source everything in that entire directory as long as it's like a zsh or all that.","01:16:54","01:17:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Now source.","01:17:04","01:17:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:17:05","01:17:06",0,"speaker 1"
"And now zzz should work.","01:17:09","01:17:12",0,"speaker 1"
"What did it just do?","01:17:18","01:17:19",0,"speaker 1"
"It opened up home three.","01:17:19","01:17:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it opened up that file.","01:17:26","01:17:28",0,"speaker 1"
"It opened up what?","01:17:30","01:17:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Zhrc.","01:17:32","01:17:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, but I don't see anything in it.","01:17:34","01:17:36",0,"speaker 1"
"It should be filled zs.","01:17:36","01:17:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it looks like there's an extra slash in the beginning for some reason.","01:17:39","01:17:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back to Zisharc.","01:17:49","01:17:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Is this rc?","01:17:55","01:17:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, the regular one?","01:17:56","01:17:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:17:57","01:17:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Windows sucks.","01:18:02","01:18:03",0,"speaker 1"
"It's something to do with pads, right?","01:18:03","01:18:05",0,"speaker 1"
"It's trying to.","01:18:05","01:18:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Where did your ZRC go?","01:18:07","01:18:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Where?","01:18:13","01:18:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's it.","01:18:14","01:18:16",0,"speaker 1"
"That is fine.","01:18:17","01:18:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go down to where the editor portion was.","01:18:17","01:18:20",0,"speaker 1"
"And we changed vi.","01:18:24","01:18:25",0,"speaker 1"
"In this case it is going to be editor, which you did.","01:18:27","01:18:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Right?","01:18:32","01:18:32",0,"speaker 1"
"It was dollar sign editor.","01:18:32","01:18:33",0,"speaker 1"
"And then what was after that?","01:18:35","01:18:37",0,"speaker 1"
"That must be what's wrong.","01:18:37","01:18:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's take a look.","01:18:39","01:18:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, down there we have alias subl.","01:18:42","01:18:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Interesting.","01:18:49","01:18:50",0,"speaker 1"
"I've never had it like this before.","01:18:51","01:18:53",0,"speaker 1"
"So we have an export editor which runs subl which isn't even defined yet because you defined it down there.","01:18:53","01:19:00",0,"speaker 1"
"That must be the problem.","01:19:04","01:19:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So here's what we're going to do.","01:19:07","01:19:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Copy.","01:19:09","01:19:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","01:19:14","01:19:15",0,"speaker 1"
"This is what we're going to do copy that path.","01:19:15","01:19:19",0,"speaker 1"
"See Mount C Program files, Sublime.","01:19:19","01:19:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Copy that whole thing.","01:19:22","01:19:23",0,"speaker 1"
"This part?","01:19:26","01:19:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, copy the whole thing and put it.","01:19:27","01:19:33",0,"speaker 1"
"No, stay in there.","01:19:33","01:19:34",0,"speaker 1"
"We're gonna.","01:19:34","01:19:35",0,"speaker 1"
"We're gonna do some things in that file and make a new export and we're gonna call it Windows Programs Export.","01:19:35","01:19:50",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll call it all caps.","01:19:50","01:19:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Windows Program files.","01:19:51","01:19:59",0,"speaker 1"
"It was Program files, right?","01:19:59","01:20:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:20:03","01:20:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Equals paste and probably in.","01:20:03","01:20:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's in quotes.","01:20:07","01:20:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase the Sublime text ending part, like from program files down.","01:20:08","01:20:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","01:20:14","01:20:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's fine.","01:20:15","01:20:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:20:16","01:20:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase.","01:20:17","01:20:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase the entire Sublime to the end, even the directory before it.","01:20:18","01:20:24",0,"speaker 1"
"But undo the typo you just created, because we're going to.","01:20:24","01:20:29",0,"speaker 1"
"You erased one letter, and I can see it haunting us in the next second.","01:20:30","01:20:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Which letter did I erase?","01:20:35","01:20:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Just undo Control Z.","01:20:37","01:20:38",0,"speaker 1"
"See the Sublime.","01:20:39","01:20:40",0,"speaker 1"
"It's now ublime, which is cool, but not the right program.","01:20:40","01:20:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase the Sublime.","01:20:46","01:20:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase from there to the end, but not the quote.","01:20:48","01:20:51",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","01:20:52","01:20:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So don't end it with a slash.","01:20:53","01:20:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Or maybe we should.","01:20:59","01:21:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's good.","01:21:04","01:21:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Leave it like that.","01:21:04","01:21:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, the next line down, we are going to have an export, which is subl.","01:21:05","01:21:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Like export all caps, Sublime, all caps.","01:21:17","01:21:22",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's going to equal in quotes.","01:21:26","01:21:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Dollar sign Windows program files.","01:21:33","01:21:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So now I'm assuming everything goes in program files.","01:21:37","01:21:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So now it'll be easier for us to like, get cursor VS code, all that stuff working.","01:21:40","01:21:45",0,"speaker 1"
"So Windows program files, slash.","01:21:45","01:21:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And you're going to paste in the.","01:21:47","01:21:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Whatever you cut from above.","01:21:49","01:21:50",0,"speaker 1"
"I got from above.","01:21:54","01:21:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:21:56","01:21:56",0,"speaker 1"
"So just paste.","01:21:56","01:21:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Just paste.","01:21:58","01:21:59",0,"speaker 1"
"This is my paste.","01:22:00","01:22:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, you copied that?","01:22:02","01:22:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:22:04","01:22:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Oops.","01:22:04","01:22:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, just undo, undo, copy and then redo, redo.","01:22:06","01:22:10",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what I do.","01:22:10","01:22:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So where did I get it from?","01:22:13","01:22:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Doesn't matter.","01:22:15","01:22:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back.","01:22:15","01:22:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back to your.","01:22:17","01:22:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Your.","01:22:18","01:22:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Your ide.","01:22:18","01:22:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back to Sublime and just undo, undo until you see the full.","01:22:19","01:22:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:22:28","01:22:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Now copy what you accidentally overwrote and then redo until you're back to where you were.","01:22:28","01:22:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Nice.","01:22:36","01:22:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Now paste.","01:22:37","01:22:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Oops.","01:22:38","01:22:38",0,"speaker 1"
"This.","01:22:40","01:22:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","01:22:40","01:22:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Undo one unselect.","01:22:40","01:22:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:22:44","01:22:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Now paste and then erase everything from the quote in the.","01:22:45","01:22:51",0,"speaker 1"
"The quote in the middle second.","01:22:51","01:22:54",0,"speaker 1"
"This.","01:22:55","01:22:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, this quote here.","01:22:55","01:22:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that quote and mount C program files, because that is implied in.","01:22:57","01:23:03",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, that's expanded from the Windows prefix, right?","01:23:03","01:23:08",0,"speaker 1"
"That.","01:23:08","01:23:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","01:23:09","01:23:09",0,"speaker 1"
"That dollar sign at the beginning should be dollars.","01:23:12","01:23:15",0,"speaker 1"
"No dot, no slash.","01:23:15","01:23:17",0,"speaker 1"
"After that Windows program file, Sublime.","01:23:17","01:23:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","01:23:20","01:23:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go down to where your editor is set, and instead of subl, you're going to dollar sign Sublime.","01:23:22","01:23:33",0,"speaker 1"
"So now it's literally the executable itself.","01:23:33","01:23:38",0,"speaker 1"
"And I'm guessing that was the problem.","01:23:39","01:23:40",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm hoping that fixes it.","01:23:40","01:23:42",0,"speaker 1"
"So SSS it's okay.","01:23:45","01:23:56",0,"speaker 1"
"So there's no longer two slashes for the home.","01:23:56","01:23:59",0,"speaker 1"
"But do you notice?","01:24:00","01:24:01",0,"speaker 1"
"I see what's wrong.","01:24:01","01:24:02",0,"speaker 1"
"It is trying to open a Linux file slash home but it's using a Windows path, the backslashes.","01:24:03","01:24:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So Windows is screwing it up again.","01:24:16","01:24:18",0,"speaker 1"
"This one is.","01:24:18","01:24:19",0,"speaker 1"
"This one is also backslash.","01:24:20","01:24:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but see how the beginning.","01:24:22","01:24:24",0,"speaker 1"
"It starts with wsl.","01:24:24","01:24:25",0,"speaker 1"
"That's right.","01:24:26","01:24:27",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what this one is missing.","01:24:28","01:24:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, and it is too.","01:24:30","01:24:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes, that's a perfect thing to.","01:24:31","01:24:36",0,"speaker 1"
"This is what I would ask AI here.","01:24:37","01:24:43",0,"speaker 1"
"How do I get what?","01:24:44","01:24:45",0,"speaker 1"
"How do I get this?","01:24:46","01:24:47",0,"speaker 1"
"How do I get to paste that?","01:24:48","01:24:49",0,"speaker 1"
"This whole.","01:24:50","01:24:51",0,"speaker 1"
"This whole path here.","01:24:51","01:24:53",0,"speaker 1"
"There's something wrong, something we're missing.","01:24:55","01:24:57",0,"speaker 1"
"There's something fundamental I'm missing.","01:24:57","01:24:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Like.","01:24:59","01:24:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Like it should know the path and I don't know what that is.","01:25:01","01:25:05",0,"speaker 1"
"And that's why I'm going to.","01:25:05","01:25:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Everything with Windows is a little bit tricky.","01:25:06","01:25:09",0,"speaker 1"
"This folder.","01:25:10","01:25:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Wow.","01:25:11","01:25:11",0,"speaker 1"
"You see using wsl, this folder, open folder, same folder.","01:25:11","01:25:23",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't get it.","01:25:24","01:25:25",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm just going to ask Gemini wsl.","01:25:26","01:25:32",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm trying to open a Windows native IDE Sublime and it opens, but it appears to be using the backslash the path format of Windows with the Linux format of.","01:25:34","01:26:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Of home user file.","01:26:17","01:26:23",0,"speaker 1"
"And I think it needs to instead look like WSL localhost, yada.","01:26:29","01:26:44",0,"speaker 1"
"That's.","01:26:44","01:26:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm just gonna tell I don't feel like typing anymore, yada and it will go.","01:26:45","01:26:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.","01:26:49","01:26:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So what is the answer?","01:26:52","01:26:53",0,"speaker 1"
"And I used to have this working.","01:26:53","01:26:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I wish I still had my Windows machine around because I can just tell you just copy all my fixes.","01:26:54","01:27:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes, you've correctly identified the issue.","01:27:04","01:27:06",0,"speaker 1"
"When you call a Windows app, you're passing it a Linux style path.","01:27:06","01:27:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Windows does not understand this use the WSL path built in feature.","01:27:10","01:27:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So I don't.","01:27:20","01:27:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so.","01:27:25","01:27:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, this is how the shell alias should look.","01:27:27","01:27:31",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, I'm gonna paste this and you put this.","01:27:31","01:27:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, this is great.","01:27:34","01:27:35",0,"speaker 1"
"This is great.","01:27:35","01:27:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, this is great.","01:27:37","01:27:38",0,"speaker 1"
"And this is actually exactly what I did for Cursor, which makes sense.","01:27:38","01:27:42",0,"speaker 1"
"So here is what you're going to post.","01:27:42","01:27:45",0,"speaker 1"
"This is going to be in your zishrc before we even set aliases.","01:27:46","01:27:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Because this is like a bootstrap.","01:27:50","01:27:52",0,"speaker 1"
"It's important, right?","01:27:52","01:27:53",0,"speaker 1"
"It's the editor.","01:27:53","01:27:53",0,"speaker 1"
"I think we lost the rest of the team.","01:27:54","01:27:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Are you kidding me?","01:27:57","01:27:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, I guess everyone so hey, you're gonna be the only productive one.","01:28:00","01:28:03",0,"speaker 1"
"What am I gonna say?","01:28:03","01:28:04",0,"speaker 1"
"I think that probably should stop at 2.","01:28:05","01:28:11",0,"speaker 1"
"What time is it?","01:28:13","01:28:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it's 2.","01:28:14","01:28:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait.","01:28:17","01:28:17",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, there's so much wait.","01:28:19","01:28:20",0,"speaker 1"
"We need to install Claude.","01:28:20","01:28:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Because that, you know, we need Claude.","01:28:22","01:28:24",0,"speaker 1"
"I. I guess they should go if they're not with us.","01:28:27","01:28:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's frustrating.","01:28:31","01:28:37",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, get your stubble to work.","01:28:37","01:28:39",0,"speaker 1"
"At least paste that into your aliases.","01:28:39","01:28:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Is that in this one?","01:28:43","01:28:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Not in your.","01:28:47","01:28:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, in this one.","01:28:47","01:28:48",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what I meant.","01:28:48","01:28:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Above.","01:28:50","01:28:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Above anything that we.","01:28:51","01:28:52",0,"speaker 1"
"All that stuff we've been defining, it should be first, right?","01:28:52","01:28:56",0,"speaker 1"
"And you don't need that alias anymore because we're making our own.","01:28:56","01:29:01",0,"speaker 1"
"That one.","01:29:04","01:29:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Get rid of that and go up and let me see what you pasted.","01:29:05","01:29:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Let me just digest for a second.","01:29:08","01:29:10",0,"speaker 1"
"You have this Windows program files, the program file itself.","01:29:11","01:29:15",0,"speaker 1"
"And down there you have Sublime text.","01:29:16","01:29:20",0,"speaker 1"
"So you're going to erase that Sublime text exe.","01:29:21","01:29:24",0,"speaker 1"
"And you're going to put dollar sign all cap.","01:29:24","01:29:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Sublime.","01:29:27","01:29:27",0,"speaker 1"
"That's the difference.","01:29:28","01:29:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Dollar sign all.","01:29:31","01:29:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, sublime.","01:29:33","01:29:34",0,"speaker 1"
"And that should.","01:29:35","01:29:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait.","01:29:39","01:29:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Go back.","01:29:42","01:29:43",0,"speaker 1"
"It said or.","01:29:43","01:29:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Or a function.","01:29:46","01:29:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, erase that function.","01:29:48","01:29:49",0,"speaker 1"
"That is that.","01:29:53","01:29:54",0,"speaker 1"
"That should work.","01:29:54","01:29:55",0,"speaker 1"
"So source that and try it.","01:29:55","01:29:57",0,"speaker 1"
"If this doesn't work, then I'll do what I can't find Mount I don't know.","01:30:02","01:30:11",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll.","01:30:13","01:30:14",0,"speaker 1"
"I guess I'll just.","01:30:14","01:30:15",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll just continue.","01:30:15","01:30:16",0,"speaker 1"
"What I meant to do is polish this up now that I have all day and all night.","01:30:16","01:30:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I don't.","01:30:21","01:30:22",0,"speaker 1"
"I have to wake up tomorrow for going away, but I'll do this on my own now.","01:30:22","01:30:27",0,"speaker 1"
"From the renewed perspective that most people are on Windows, which is so bad, but doable.","01:30:27","01:30:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:30:40","01:30:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:30:44","01:30:44",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so I will also feed this into AI and extract all the step by steps that actually worked so we can consolidate and not have a bunch of, like, do this.","01:30:44","01:30:57",0,"speaker 1"
"No, wait.","01:30:57","01:30:58",0,"speaker 1"
"I meant this.","01:30:58","01:30:58",0,"speaker 1"
"No, wait.","01:30:58","01:30:59",0,"speaker 1"
"This.","01:30:59","01:30:59",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","01:30:59","01:31:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:31:01","01:31:01",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","01:31:02","01:31:03",0,"speaker 1"
"You may.","01:31:03","01:31:03",0,"speaker 1"
"You.","01:31:03","01:31:03",0,"speaker 1"
"You are relieved.","01:31:03","01:31:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Did you send me something?","01:31:06","01:31:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, you might send you my error.","01:31:09","01:31:13",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, perfect.","01:31:13","01:31:16",0,"speaker 1"
"I will.","01:31:16","01:31:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:31:16","01:31:17",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll talk to you soon.","01:31:17","01:31:18",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll let you know if I.","01:31:18","01:31:19",0,"speaker 1"
"If I find.","01:31:19","01:31:19",0,"speaker 1"
"When I find that answer, and we'll.","01:31:20","01:31:26",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll.","01:31:26","01:31:27",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll tell Gershon and we'll regroup.","01:31:27","01:31:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Thank you.","01:31:29","01:31:30",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","01:31:31","01:31:32",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm having nosebleed here.","01:31:35","01:31:36",1,"speaker 2"
"You're here the whole time?","01:31:37","01:31:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:31:40","01:31:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Why didn't you speak up?","01:31:41","01:31:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Why don't you tell me?","01:31:42","01:31:43",0,"speaker 1"
"No, it's okay.","01:31:44","01:31:45",1,"speaker 2"
"I mean, it's.","01:31:45","01:31:46",1,"speaker 2"
"It's important.","01:31:46","01:31:46",1,"speaker 2"
"If CV can move forward on.","01:31:47","01:31:50",1,"speaker 2"
"On his laptop.","01:31:51","01:31:53",1,"speaker 2"
"It will take a while if you.","01:31:54","01:31:56",1,"speaker 2"
"If you're going to resolve each one of us, you know.","01:31:56","01:31:59",1,"speaker 2"
"I mean, yeah, I mean, maybe once again.","01:32:02","01:32:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah.","01:32:08","01:32:10",1,"speaker 2"
"I mean, the goal now instead will be for me to.","01:32:10","01:32:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Now that I know how you have it, you should be able to run a command and it should do all this.","01:32:15","01:32:20",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have to.","01:32:20","01:32:21",0,"speaker 1"
"What took long is typing in all that crap and doing all that manually.","01:32:21","01:32:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Really.","01:32:26","01:32:26",0,"speaker 1"
"We should be able to run a script that sets it all up.","01:32:26","01:32:29",0,"speaker 1"
"That would be a lot easier.","01:32:30","01:32:31",0,"speaker 1"
"And then debug that rather than each step one by one.","01:32:31","01:32:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Debug, debug.","01:32:34","01:32:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Though I have a really quick question for.","01:32:37","01:32:40",1,"speaker 2"
"I'm not going anywhere.","01:32:41","01:32:42",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll stay with you and work if you're up.","01:32:42","01:32:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I know where you are.","01:32:45","01:32:46",0,"speaker 1"
"So, yeah, I do have that Penguin also.","01:32:47","01:32:49",1,"speaker 2"
"And I used to work from here from my C drive and then work and then from.","01:32:50","01:33:02",1,"speaker 2"
"From this directory.","01:33:02","01:33:03",1,"speaker 2"
"This is where I used to work.","01:33:04","01:33:06",1,"speaker 2"
"Now what you're trying to propose is we're going to have our work directory here.","01:33:07","01:33:16",1,"speaker 2"
"And the reason is it's not even like a choice, right.","01:33:19","01:33:22",0,"speaker 1"
"The reason is anything with a C colon is running a different architecture.","01:33:22","01:33:27",0,"speaker 1"
"That's x86 windows, right?","01:33:27","01:33:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, yep.","01:33:30","01:33:31",1,"speaker 2"
"And even though you're using, you know, even though you think you're using Linux, and maybe you even are, the files that you put in here are going to be Windows, not Unix.","01:33:31","01:33:44",0,"speaker 1"
"So even if you have the same exact files you copy them over, one will be stored with Unix pointers and one is stored with Windows X or Windows architecture pointers, whatever they are.","01:33:45","01:33:58",0,"speaker 1"
"It's confusing because I even me, like I have a git code repo in my Windows and I have one on my Linux, but I could see them both in my directory.","01:34:00","01:34:09",0,"speaker 1"
"But one of them is only accessible through Windows files like Claude desktop, and one of them is only accessible through Linux unless you mount.","01:34:09","01:34:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Unless you have a mount, which is a way around that.","01:34:22","01:34:26",0,"speaker 1"
"But you need one in both directions.","01:34:26","01:34:28",0,"speaker 1"
"You need to have Linux mounting Windows, which is the MNT C, and then you have Windows mounting the Linux, which is what you see with this Penguin.","01:34:28","01:34:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's confusing.","01:34:37","01:34:39",0,"speaker 1"
"There's no reason to ever be using Windows to develop.","01:34:39","01:34:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's just pain.","01:34:43","01:34:44",0,"speaker 1"
"And you'll learn how to deal with it because you're a Windows user and they're used to pain.","01:34:44","01:34:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","01:34:50","01:34:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Unless you're playing games then, Man, Windows is awesome.","01:34:51","01:34:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I am playing games.","01:34:57","01:34:58",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, exactly.","01:34:59","01:35:00",0,"speaker 1"
"And why do you think I used WSL for years I was a gamer.","01:35:00","01:35:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Like I refused to switch to Linux.","01:35:03","01:35:06",0,"speaker 1"
"But yeah, okay, but I think I'm missing first step here.","01:35:07","01:35:10",1,"speaker 2"
"So I believe cv you have something in here in the first place because this is empty for me.","01:35:11","01:35:20",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh yeah, you got to clone it.","01:35:22","01:35:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so this is where the code goes.","01:35:25","01:35:28",1,"speaker 2"
"All right.","01:35:28","01:35:28",1,"speaker 2"
"All right.","01:35:28","01:35:29",1,"speaker 2"
"That's where you're going to clone.","01:35:29","01:35:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Try note, try note.","01:35:30","01:35:32",0,"speaker 1"
"2.0 triumph dev all that stuff is going to go into there and you can't just copy those.","01:35:32","01:35:37",0,"speaker 1"
"I think I can take that offline.","01:35:40","01:35:43",1,"speaker 2"
"I can follow from the recording itself because that's the missing part.","01:35:44","01:35:50",1,"speaker 2"
"And I think Malky also have the same issue earlier.","01:35:50","01:35:53",1,"speaker 2"
"We do not know that we needed to clone it here.","01:35:54","01:35:59",1,"speaker 2"
"I didn't clone it either.","01:36:01","01:36:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yet.","01:36:02","01:36:02",0,"speaker 1"
"I haven't cloned it either yet.","01:36:03","01:36:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, we didn't get to that part.","01:36:04","01:36:05",0,"speaker 1"
"There's nothing to clone.","01:36:06","01:36:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, we didn't get to cloning repos and working with the code.","01:36:09","01:36:13",0,"speaker 1"
"We're still bootstrapping all our tools.","01:36:13","01:36:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, I'm kind of lost there.","01:36:19","01:36:21",1,"speaker 2"
"So to summarize what we did, right, we enabled WSL and then we installed our shell.","01:36:24","01:36:36",0,"speaker 1"
"The shell that we're going to use because Windows uses PowerShell and we can't use that.","01:36:36","01:36:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So we installed Zish as our shell and then we configured Zish.","01:36:41","01:36:45",0,"speaker 1"
"That's all we really did.","01:36:47","01:36:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but what's the reason that config is not.","01:36:49","01:36:53",1,"speaker 2"
"It's not on main.","01:36:55","01:36:57",1,"speaker 2"
"It's not where I get.","01:36:58","01:37:01",0,"speaker 1"
"I cannot do CDcode config.","01:37:01","01:37:04",1,"speaker 2"
"Want to share your screen?","01:37:05","01:37:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you'll see better.","01:37:06","01:37:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry.","01:37:10","01:37:10",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, that's your screen.","01:37:12","01:37:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, this is my screen.","01:37:14","01:37:15",1,"speaker 2"
"I found my screen.","01:37:15","01:37:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So how, first of all, how are you root?","01:37:16","01:37:20",0,"speaker 1"
"You shouldn't be ever be root on a windowsl drive?","01:37:22","01:37:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I'm not sure why.","01:37:28","01:37:29",1,"speaker 2"
"Actually, that's part of the problem.","01:37:29","01:37:31",0,"speaker 1"
"This.","01:37:31","01:37:31",1,"speaker 2"
"This console is from this penguin here.","01:37:32","01:37:37",1,"speaker 2"
"Right click get into the settings.","01:37:39","01:37:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, See Error.","01:37:40","01:37:41",0,"speaker 1"
"You start off with an error, it starts it with an error.","01:37:42","01:37:44",0,"speaker 1"
"There's something wrong.","01:37:44","01:37:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Set up.","01:37:45","01:37:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so go to your settings for your WSL.","01:37:48","01:37:51",0,"speaker 1"
"It must be configured wrong here.","01:37:51","01:37:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Open up PowerShell.","01:37:54","01:37:55",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll tell you.","01:37:55","01:37:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Open up PowerShell.","01:37:56","01:37:56",0,"speaker 1"
"This is how I deal with all my WSL issues.","01:37:56","01:37:59",0,"speaker 1"
"First thing you do, type.","01:38:01","01:38:02",0,"speaker 1"
"You're going to run WSL with some options.","01:38:02","01:38:05",0,"speaker 1"
"We want.","01:38:05","01:38:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I see you just did an install of it.","01:38:05","01:38:09",0,"speaker 1"
"It looks new, right?","01:38:09","01:38:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Is that new?","01:38:10","01:38:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:38:12","01:38:13",1,"speaker 2"
"All right, so the problem is you opened an administrator shell.","01:38:13","01:38:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Could that be it?","01:38:19","01:38:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you open a normal shell now with your user do WSL Space dash install.","01:38:20","01:38:37",0,"speaker 1"
"So yeah, it is doing.","01:38:41","01:38:43",0,"speaker 1"
"If you installed it would be.","01:38:43","01:38:45",0,"speaker 1"
"It wouldn't do this.","01:38:45","01:38:46",0,"speaker 1"
"So you now have.","01:38:48","01:38:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Because really it has its.","01:38:51","01:38:54",0,"speaker 1"
"You don't have multiple.","01:38:54","01:38:55",0,"speaker 1"
"It's not a multi user system.","01:38:55","01:38:56",0,"speaker 1"
"So if you install it as admin.","01:38:57","01:39:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh my God, a distro.","01:39:01","01:39:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Already exists.","01:39:06","01:39:07",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay.","01:39:07","01:39:08",1,"speaker 2"
"Can'T you just erase that one?","01:39:12","01:39:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you wcel uninstall Ubuntu?","01:39:14","01:39:16",0,"speaker 1"
"You're going to have to probably be administrator.","01:39:16","01:39:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Nice.","01:39:25","01:39:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So many side quests.","01:39:25","01:39:27",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","01:39:29","01:39:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","01:39:32","01:39:32",1,"speaker 2"
"What happened?","01:39:32","01:39:33",1,"speaker 2"
"Is it working?","01:39:35","01:39:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Is it uninstalling?","01:39:35","01:39:36",0,"speaker 1"
"I think so.","01:39:36","01:39:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","01:39:39","01:39:40",1,"speaker 2"
"I just lost my.","01:39:40","01:39:41",1,"speaker 2"
"Here.","01:39:41","01:39:42",1,"speaker 2"
"Good.","01:39:42","01:39:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, now it's done.","01:39:45","01:39:47",1,"speaker 2"
"Now as not your administrator, which you are.","01:39:47","01:39:51",0,"speaker 1"
"It's fine right here.","01:39:51","01:39:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So you want to install now.","01:39:52","01:40:08",0,"speaker 1"
"It required elevation, but I didn't see you click anything.","01:40:08","01:40:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Did you click?","01:40:12","01:40:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Did you elevate?","01:40:12","01:40:13",0,"speaker 1"
"None yet.","01:40:16","01:40:16",1,"speaker 2"
"I'm not doing anything yet.","01:40:16","01:40:17",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay.","01:40:18","01:40:18",0,"speaker 1"
"It could be stuck on waiting for you to elevate.","01:40:27","01:40:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there a tab open maybe like at the very bottom?","01:40:30","01:40:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it's still going.","01:40:33","01:40:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","01:40:33","01:40:34",0,"speaker 1"
"No, no, it's downloading.","01:40:34","01:40:35",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","01:40:35","01:40:36",0,"speaker 1"
"I wonder if Maki had the same issue with her administrator.","01:40:46","01:40:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe.","01:40:51","01:40:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, okay.","01:40:53","01:40:54",1,"speaker 2"
"I still have the same error here.","01:40:54","01:40:56",1,"speaker 2"
"Can't.","01:40:59","01:40:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Can't.","01:40:59","01:41:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Do you have any AI?","01:41:00","01:41:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Do you have Claude or something?","01:41:01","01:41:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you just.","01:41:03","01:41:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, we shouldn't be having problems that we think about anymore.","01:41:04","01:41:09",0,"speaker 1"
"So anytime I see that, I think it's a red flag.","01:41:09","01:41:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So just paste that in and say some context.","01:41:13","01:41:20",0,"speaker 1"
"You said, I think I installed as admin.","01:41:20","01:41:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Trying to reinstall.","01:41:22","01:41:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Let me see what it says there.","01:41:51","01:41:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh yeah, we definitely have to do a shutdown.","01:41:52","01:41:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","01:41:54","01:41:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Go all the way up.","01:41:55","01:41:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Up.","01:41:56","01:41:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's say solution one.","01:41:58","01:42:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Unregister one goes here.","01:42:01","01:42:03",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, the secret word.","01:42:03","01:42:04",0,"speaker 1"
"And then install.","01:42:05","01:42:06",0,"speaker 1"
"I want to see what it's.","01:42:06","01:42:07",0,"speaker 1"
"What it.","01:42:07","01:42:08",0,"speaker 1"
"What is it?","01:42:08","01:42:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Complaint.","01:42:09","01:42:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Go.","01:42:10","01:42:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Go down.","01:42:10","01:42:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Let me see what else it thinks.","01:42:10","01:42:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Use it.","01:42:12","01:42:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, go down.","01:42:13","01:42:14",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't want to use a different name.","01:42:14","01:42:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Complete reset.","01:42:16","01:42:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Nuclear shutdown.","01:42:18","01:42:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Unregistered.","01:42:19","01:42:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Distro.","01:42:20","01:42:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Disable.","01:42:22","01:42:23",0,"speaker 1"
"W. No, I don't want to disable.","01:42:23","01:42:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's talking about disabling.","01:42:25","01:42:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:42:29","01:42:29",0,"speaker 1"
"But after restarting, the next step will be enabling it again.","01:42:29","01:42:34",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, interesting.","01:42:35","01:42:36",0,"speaker 1"
"I guess this is saying this is because people probably had this problem.","01:42:36","01:42:41",0,"speaker 1"
"And by the way, if you can't get it to work, just do this.","01:42:41","01:42:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's try the easy one first.","01:42:46","01:42:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Step one.","01:42:49","01:42:50",1,"speaker 2"
"The solution one.","01:42:50","01:42:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep, we'll try that.","01:42:51","01:42:52",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll try.","01:42:52","01:42:53",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't need to.","01:42:53","01:42:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:42:54","01:42:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:42:54","01:42:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, I think it's just ubuntu we don't need to list it.","01:42:54","01:42:57",0,"speaker 1"
"We are going to do wsl.","01:42:57","01:42:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Unregister Ubuntu.","01:42:58","01:43:00",0,"speaker 1"
"And now I lost my powershell.","01:43:05","01:43:07",1,"speaker 2"
"It's that stupid that it has to download the goddamn thing again.","01:43:27","01:43:30",0,"speaker 1"
"It can't cache it.","01:43:30","01:43:32",0,"speaker 1"
"It's like you could check Summit.","01:43:32","01:43:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Like there's no reason.","01:43:34","01:43:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Windows.","01:43:36","01:43:36",0,"speaker 1"
"It was pretty fast, though.","01:43:43","01:43:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, okay.","01:43:56","01:43:57",1,"speaker 2"
"Now, did you do this?","01:44:00","01:44:01",0,"speaker 1"
"It's asking you to create a user account.","01:44:01","01:44:03",0,"speaker 1"
"So you should create your username.","01:44:03","01:44:06",0,"speaker 1"
"The same one in Windows.","01:44:06","01:44:07",0,"speaker 1"
"It should be the same, or else you're gonna have problems.","01:44:07","01:44:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, what's my name here?","01:44:10","01:44:13",1,"speaker 2"
"Is it J A?","01:44:14","01:44:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","01:44:16","01:44:16",1,"speaker 2"
"So then it's J A.","01:44:17","01:44:18",0,"speaker 1"
"That won't be enough.","01:44:18","01:44:19",1,"speaker 2"
"Wait, wait, wait.","01:44:22","01:44:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I was gonna say it's gotta be lowercase.","01:44:25","01:44:27",0,"speaker 1"

"But typically I'll just paste it here.","01:54:27","01:54:29",1,"speaker 2"
"Let me say.","01:54:30","01:54:30",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","01:54:30","01:54:30",0,"speaker 1"

"But it's here.","01:54:52","01:54:53",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's just a better way to do things in your terminal.","01:54:53","01:54:59",0,"speaker 1"
"But you can exit this if you want by just doing control O, which brings up a sub menu for sessions.","01:54:59","01:55:06",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you can quit or detach.","01:55:07","01:55:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's do a detach.","01:55:10","01:55:12",0,"speaker 1"

"Dash Triumph.","02:10:10","02:10:12",0,"speaker 1"
"It might yell at you because the T is capitalized, but.","02:10:15","02:10:19",0,"speaker 1"
"And then slash.","02:10:22","02:10:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Zishy zish zshy zsh.","02:10:24","02:10:30",0,"speaker 1"
"H Y, zsh.","02:10:31","02:10:34",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","02:10:36","02:10:36",0,"speaker 1"
"And then.","02:10:41","02:10:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes.","02:10:42","02:10:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes.","02:10:46","02:10:46",1,"speaker 2"
"All right, I'm.","02:10:52","02:10:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we need to get your editor.","02:10:55","02:11:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You're using Embed.","02:11:01","02:11:02",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to use Sublime.","02:11:04","02:11:05",0,"speaker 1"
"You can also use Cursor if you have it installed.","02:11:05","02:11:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Or Sublime.","02:11:07","02:11:10",0,"speaker 1"
"You know, anything.","02:11:10","02:11:10",0,"speaker 1"
"You can use the new Helix, which is like Sublime but modern.","02:11:10","02:11:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, let's do that.","02:11:16","02:11:17",1,"speaker 2"
"So that I will be a cool kid.","02:11:17","02:11:19",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, you will.","02:11:20","02:11:21",0,"speaker 1"
"You will.","02:11:21","02:11:22",0,"speaker 1"
"One of the cool kids.","02:11:24","02:11:25",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, how do we do that?","02:11:25","02:11:26",1,"speaker 2"
"From the browser?","02:11:26","02:11:27",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, I'm gonna.","02:11:30","02:11:30",0,"speaker 1"
"I was gonna look up in the browser.","02:11:30","02:11:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Let me see.","02:11:32","02:11:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Helix Editor or ide.","02:11:32","02:11:35",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know what they.","02:11:35","02:11:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Here it is.","02:11:37","02:11:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Helix Editor.","02:11:38","02:11:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Modern.","02:11:39","02:11:40",0,"speaker 1"
"A postmodern editor.","02:11:40","02:11:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","02:11:42","02:11:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Does it even have a. Oh, it has tree sitter built in.","02:11:43","02:11:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Dude, this is.","02:11:46","02:11:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's built in rust.","02:11:48","02:11:49",0,"speaker 1"
"It's going to be really fast.","02:11:49","02:11:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So good.","02:11:52","02:11:52",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, it's not better than neovim, because that's the real.","02:11:53","02:11:57",0,"speaker 1"
"That's like the.","02:11:57","02:11:58",0,"speaker 1"
"That's it.","02:11:58","02:11:59",0,"speaker 1"
"But if you're going to use like.","02:11:59","02:12:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Like.","02:12:01","02:12:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, so whatever.","02:12:04","02:12:05",0,"speaker 1"
"You're gonna have to install this in Windows.","02:12:05","02:12:07",0,"speaker 1"
"So where it says install now, just install it and then we will copy the path and.","02:12:09","02:12:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, I'm a bit lost.","02:12:18","02:12:21",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, Windows here using winget.","02:12:22","02:12:25",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep, yep.","02:12:26","02:12:27",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","02:12:28","02:12:29",1,"speaker 2"
"But, but I will not be using this terminal.","02:12:31","02:12:34",1,"speaker 2"
"No, no.","02:12:34","02:12:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, let's use Power Fill then.","02:12:37","02:12:42",1,"speaker 2"
"No, not administrator.","02:12:45","02:12:46",0,"speaker 1"
"You want this to be for the local user.","02:12:46","02:12:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you're right.","02:12:49","02:12:50",1,"speaker 2"
"All right, let's see.","02:13:03","02:13:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, it's done.","02:13:32","02:13:34",1,"speaker 2"
"Are you going to be able to get Dami.","02:13:39","02:13:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Where is it now?","02:13:51","02:13:52",1,"speaker 2"
"So it's installed.","02:13:52","02:13:54",0,"speaker 1"
"You should be able to just type it.","02:13:54","02:13:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Type Helix.","02:13:55","02:13:56",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","02:14:00","02:14:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, hx.","02:14:05","02:14:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","02:14:10","02:14:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Type it from the command line like it says.","02:14:11","02:14:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it has to be typed in there first.","02:14:13","02:14:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Like so where?","02:14:17","02:14:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Right there.","02:14:18","02:14:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Type X HX and maybe hate Windows.","02:14:18","02:14:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Like it literally says, installed successfully installed path environment modified.","02:14:35","02:14:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, restart your shell to use it.","02:14:45","02:14:48",0,"speaker 1"
"That's the problem.","02:14:51","02:14:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Is Windows going to make you log out of Windows?","02:14:53","02:14:55",0,"speaker 1"
"I bet it is that.","02:14:55","02:14:56",0,"speaker 1"
"It's going to freaking make you.","02:14:56","02:14:57",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so close this terminal.","02:14:57","02:14:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Open a new windows.","02:14:59","02:15:00",0,"speaker 1"
"PowerShell I'm now HX.","02:15:00","02:15:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Nice.","02:15:12","02:15:12",0,"speaker 1"
"And now you need to find out where that is in your PowerShell.","02:15:12","02:15:22",0,"speaker 1"
"You could type.","02:15:22","02:15:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Does PowerShell even operate like that?","02:15:26","02:15:28",0,"speaker 1"
"I could type which.","02:15:30","02:15:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean.","02:15:36","02:15:37",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","02:15:40","02:15:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait.","02:15:44","02:15:45",1,"speaker 2"
"Where?","02:15:47","02:15:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Clear.","02:15:52","02:15:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes.","02:15:54","02:15:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Downloaded.","02:15:57","02:15:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Installed Helix XH using winget.","02:16:00","02:16:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Where the fuck is it?","02:16:08","02:16:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Note not this computer program files Helix.","02:16:20","02:16:32",0,"speaker 1"
"If it is.","02:16:34","02:16:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, but if it's installed as a user, it's users username.","02:16:35","02:16:39",0,"speaker 1"
"App data, local programs Helix.","02:16:39","02:16:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Convenient Windows.","02:16:42","02:16:43",0,"speaker 1"
"So user.","02:16:47","02:16:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, that's it.","02:16:48","02:16:49",0,"speaker 1"
"And then it's app data.","02:16:49","02:16:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I think app data is hidden to make it even harder.","02:16:53","02:16:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Is that the wrong app data?","02:17:01","02:17:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you only have a thousand.","02:17:02","02:17:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Make sure you look in each of them.","02:17:04","02:17:05",0,"speaker 1"
"AWS A N. I don't see it there.","02:17:14","02:17:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it's not hidden.","02:17:22","02:17:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there?","02:17:23","02:17:24",0,"speaker 1"
"When it's not hidden.","02:17:24","02:17:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Here, let me paste it.","02:17:28","02:17:29",0,"speaker 1"
"You should be able to paste this into your.","02:17:30","02:17:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Into your browser.","02:17:34","02:17:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, not really.","02:17:41","02:17:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Because of the username part.","02:17:42","02:17:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:17:44","02:17:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait just a second.","02:17:47","02:17:48",1,"speaker 2"
"And I think it's ja.","02:17:54","02:17:55",0,"speaker 1"
"You forget what?","02:17:56","02:18:00",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so let's try the other.","02:18:01","02:18:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's try the one that's in your system.","02:18:03","02:18:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, you.","02:18:06","02:18:07",0,"speaker 1"
"In PowerShell, you could say Winget.","02:18:07","02:18:08",0,"speaker 1"
"List Helix and it'll tell you.","02:18:09","02:18:11",0,"speaker 1"
"I like that idea.","02:18:12","02:18:13",0,"speaker 1"
"But you got to get out of this editor, which I don't know how to do.","02:18:16","02:18:22",0,"speaker 1"
"How do you get out of it?","02:18:22","02:18:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it's.","02:18:23","02:18:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Is it colon?","02:18:24","02:18:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Like is it escape?","02:18:24","02:18:26",0,"speaker 1"
"You gotta find what the command.","02:18:26","02:18:27",0,"speaker 1"
"But maybe it's control P. Command P. You know how like ideas try to do it?","02:18:27","02:18:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, list Helix.","02:18:33","02:18:37",0,"speaker 1"
"What List?","02:18:50","02:18:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's what it says.","02:18:56","02:18:57",0,"speaker 1"
"List Helix.","02:18:57","02:18:58",0,"speaker 1"
"That should show you where it is.","02:18:58","02:18:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Try.","02:19:03","02:19:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, wait.","02:19:08","02:19:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So the updated one, that was a no go?","02:19:08","02:19:10",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","02:19:12","02:19:12",0,"speaker 1"
"What about program?","02:19:19","02:19:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Program files.","02:19:20","02:19:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","02:19:28","02:19:28",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, what App data local Helix.","02:19:32","02:19:34",0,"speaker 1"
"No, wait.","02:19:34","02:19:35",0,"speaker 1"
"That's a text document.","02:19:35","02:19:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:19:37","02:19:37",1,"speaker 2"
"Wait, programs I do not have.","02:19:39","02:19:47",1,"speaker 2"
"No, I do have.","02:19:47","02:19:48",1,"speaker 2"
"It's packages.","02:19:48","02:19:49",0,"speaker 1"
"App local.","02:19:49","02:19:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","02:19:51","02:19:52",0,"speaker 1"
"App data local.","02:19:52","02:19:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Microsoft.","02:19:53","02:19:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Do you see Microsoft there?","02:19:54","02:19:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And then Winget and then packages and then Helix.","02:19:59","02:20:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Helix, Helix.","02:20:11","02:20:12",0,"speaker 1"
"There it is.","02:20:14","02:20:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's not lose that thing.","02:20:15","02:20:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Pin it.","02:20:19","02:20:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Desktop it, shortcut it.","02:20:19","02:20:21",0,"speaker 1"
"And then we need.","02:20:21","02:20:23",0,"speaker 1"
"We need to get the path to it because I don't want to type that in.","02:20:25","02:20:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Damn.","02:20:35","02:20:36",1,"speaker 2"
"We are at the part that Zvi failed at, remember?","02:20:41","02:20:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","02:20:46","02:20:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's see what the idiomatic way to do this is.","02:20:47","02:20:49",0,"speaker 1"
"I. I'm going to say how.","02:20:49","02:20:52",0,"speaker 1"
"What is the idiomatic way to open this executable from my WSL shell?","02:20:55","02:21:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Should I.","02:21:19","02:21:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Should I use.","02:21:23","02:21:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Should I be using the Windows path like this, like C colon, slash, program files, yada, or the mount which is M slashment slash, C slash, yada?","02:21:25","02:21:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's see what it says.","02:21:55","02:21:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm asking Amazon Q, by the way, it says from Win.","02:21:58","02:22:05",0,"speaker 1"
"From wsl, you should be using slash mount.","02:22:05","02:22:07",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the way to access Windows from wsl.","02:22:08","02:22:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Try this.","02:22:12","02:22:13",0,"speaker 1"
"To make it convenient, you should install an alias in your sysrc.","02:22:15","02:22:19",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so I will.","02:22:21","02:22:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I like that idea even more.","02:22:25","02:22:28",0,"speaker 1"
"You can create a symlink to it from your local bin.","02:22:31","02:22:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's try that.","02:22:34","02:22:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Because that I just like.","02:22:35","02:22:38",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","02:22:38","02:22:39",0,"speaker 1"
"I like symlinks especially.","02:22:39","02:22:40",0,"speaker 1"
"They're easy to remove.","02:22:42","02:22:43",0,"speaker 1"
"And then.","02:22:43","02:22:43",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, here, paste this.","02:22:43","02:22:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, you're not gonna be able to paste it because the username or the path isn't exact, but copy.","02:22:46","02:22:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:22:57","02:22:57",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, here's what I'm going to do.","02:22:57","02:22:59",1,"speaker 2"
"Let's extract this thing.","02:22:59","02:23:01",1,"speaker 2"
"And here.","02:23:04","02:23:05",1,"speaker 2"
"Come on, pilgrims.","02:23:09","02:23:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Pilgrims.","02:23:15","02:23:16",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the path, like so.","02:23:19","02:23:26",1,"speaker 2"
"Why is that?","02:23:27","02:23:28",1,"speaker 2"
"Yours doesn't have.","02:23:28","02:23:29",1,"speaker 2"
"That's wrong.","02:23:31","02:23:32",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase slash, mount.","02:23:32","02:23:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, erase the C. All the.","02:23:34","02:23:37",0,"speaker 1"
"All the slashes are the wrong direction, too.","02:23:38","02:23:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, I'll be reversing the slashes.","02:23:50","02:23:54",1,"speaker 2"
"Just a second.","02:23:55","02:23:56",1,"speaker 2"
"There you go.","02:24:08","02:24:09",1,"speaker 2"
"I like it.","02:24:11","02:24:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Now erase the C colon.","02:24:12","02:24:13",0,"speaker 1"
"And in the front, you need mnt C. Yeah, you're replacing C colon with mnt slash C lowercase.","02:24:16","02:24:26",0,"speaker 1"
"That's basically how you refer to your C drive.","02:24:27","02:24:30",0,"speaker 1"
"And then this one.","02:24:31","02:24:32",1,"speaker 2"
"That unfortunately looks correct.","02:24:34","02:24:36",0,"speaker 1"
"What a crappy path.","02:24:36","02:24:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, my God.","02:24:38","02:24:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Jesus, I hate Windows.","02:24:39","02:24:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so that is exactly correct.","02:24:41","02:24:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","02:24:46","02:24:47",0,"speaker 1"
"But you can't do it here.","02:24:48","02:24:49",0,"speaker 1"
"You're in Windows.","02:24:49","02:24:50",0,"speaker 1"
"You gotta go back to your Ubuntu window.","02:24:51","02:24:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, okay.","02:24:55","02:24:57",1,"speaker 2"
"The one here?","02:24:57","02:24:58",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep.","02:24:58","02:24:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So just paste it there.","02:25:00","02:25:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I'm so excited.","02:25:02","02:25:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Now it should.","02:25:04","02:25:05",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't even need to resource it or anything because symlinks just work.","02:25:05","02:25:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So you should be able to type HX and then some file, like press Tab to see what's in this directory.","02:25:08","02:25:16",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","02:25:19","02:25:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it worked.","02:25:20","02:25:20",0,"speaker 1"
"It worked, but we still didn't see.","02:25:20","02:25:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, now I lost it.","02:25:24","02:25:26",1,"speaker 2"
"I don't know what you opened.","02:25:26","02:25:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's close this.","02:25:27","02:25:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait.","02:25:29","02:25:30",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, first let's learn how to close Helix.","02:25:30","02:25:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you try colon Q?","02:25:32","02:25:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Just a second.","02:25:39","02:25:39",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, okay.","02:25:45","02:25:46",1,"speaker 2"
"There you go.","02:25:46","02:25:47",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, so HX and Tab.","02:25:50","02:25:54",1,"speaker 2"
"Press Tab so we can see what's in this directory.","02:25:54","02:25:57",0,"speaker 1"
"No, no.","02:25:58","02:25:59",0,"speaker 1"
"HX space.","02:25:59","02:26:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Now.","02:26:02","02:26:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Now is when you would type a file.","02:26:03","02:26:04",0,"speaker 1"
"But since we don't know a file, we're going to press Tab and hope that it will say like, here's all the files in this directory there.","02:26:04","02:26:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So now tab twice.","02:26:10","02:26:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Is it not going to there?","02:26:13","02:26:15",0,"speaker 1"
"We could select.","02:26:15","02:26:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So press left.","02:26:16","02:26:18",0,"speaker 1"
"The arrow.","02:26:22","02:26:23",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, yeah.","02:26:23","02:26:24",0,"speaker 1"
"See, this is how I navigate.","02:26:25","02:26:27",0,"speaker 1"
"This is how we should be.","02:26:27","02:26:28",0,"speaker 1"
"This is nice.","02:26:28","02:26:29",0,"speaker 1"
"So go to Zishy Zish and press Enter.","02:26:29","02:26:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press Tab.","02:26:32","02:26:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Press Tab again.","02:26:36","02:26:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Now pick the aliases.","02:26:38","02:26:40",0,"speaker 1"
"One.","02:26:40","02:26:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So Tab.","02:26:42","02:26:42",0,"speaker 1"
"The first one.","02:26:45","02:26:46",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep.","02:26:46","02:26:46",0,"speaker 1"
"And then enter.","02:26:50","02:26:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So now we are.","02:26:55","02:26:56",0,"speaker 1"
"We are officially farther than three, because now that when you.","02:26:56","02:26:59",0,"speaker 1"
"When he did this, it didn't work.","02:26:59","02:27:00",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","02:27:02","02:27:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, so Helix, it looks plain, but like it's got a very lot of customizable.","02:27:04","02:27:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Like some people go and they make it have dynamic windows and like you could do crazy things with it or just use it as an editor.","02:27:10","02:27:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So that's why I like it as like a default.","02:27:17","02:27:19",0,"speaker 1"
"I would definitely change the color scheme because.","02:27:22","02:27:24",0,"speaker 1"
"So plain and not exciting.","02:27:25","02:27:26",0,"speaker 1"
"But let's.","02:27:27","02:27:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, let's.","02:27:29","02:27:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's make this better.","02:27:29","02:27:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So first we need to delete all the personal stuff.","02:27:32","02:27:35",0,"speaker 1"
"I would delete from.","02:27:35","02:27:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, delete that block, though.","02:27:39","02:27:41",0,"speaker 1"
"That whole block that quick access defaults.","02:27:41","02:27:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:27:46","02:27:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Did it not let you delete?","02:27:51","02:27:52",0,"speaker 1"
"I am doing that though.","02:27:58","02:27:59",1,"speaker 2"
"What?","02:28:01","02:28:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Just a second.","02:28:03","02:28:03",1,"speaker 2"
"Press the number the letter D. Press the letter D.","02:28:05","02:28:07",0,"speaker 1"
"That's how you delete.","02:28:13","02:28:14",1,"speaker 2"
"I just confirmed that just means it's using VIM bindings.","02:28:15","02:28:18",0,"speaker 1"
"It's using vim, which is Neo Vim, which is.","02:28:18","02:28:21",0,"speaker 1"
"I didn't know Helix, but I'm sure you can turn that off.","02:28:22","02:28:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Otherwise people wouldn't use.","02:28:25","02:28:26",0,"speaker 1"
"What else?","02:28:30","02:28:31",1,"speaker 2"
"Select to select.","02:28:32","02:28:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, that's.","02:28:33","02:28:34",0,"speaker 1"
"You can do that or you can press V and then use the arrow.","02:28:34","02:28:38",0,"speaker 1"
"V will start a block selection.","02:28:38","02:28:40",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you can press down, down, down and see, like that.","02:28:42","02:28:45",0,"speaker 1"
"But we are deleting the aliases.","02:28:48","02:28:50",1,"speaker 2"
"No, no, you want to keep all.","02:28:50","02:28:51",0,"speaker 1"
"That's all good stuff.","02:28:51","02:28:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so escape to get out of that.","02:28:53","02:28:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Escape.","02:28:58","02:28:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, and now go.","02:28:59","02:29:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You can delete all that docker stuff.","02:29:05","02:29:07",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't need.","02:29:07","02:29:08",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll tell you where.","02:29:11","02:29:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Go up, up.","02:29:13","02:29:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Line.","02:29:14","02:29:15",1,"speaker 2"
"What line 28.","02:29:15","02:29:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Start from there and we're going to delete.","02:29:17","02:29:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Press down.","02:29:22","02:29:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Just go down, down.","02:29:23","02:29:25",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll delete Most of this we'll build up our own aliases.","02:29:25","02:29:29",0,"speaker 1"
"So go down.","02:29:29","02:29:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Way down.","02:29:32","02:29:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep going.","02:29:33","02:29:33",0,"speaker 1"
"I think we want to go down to where we get to.","02:29:34","02:29:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","02:29:39","02:29:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Delete the Amazon things.","02:29:39","02:29:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Delete the N8N extensions.","02:29:42","02:29:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Go up.","02:29:49","02:29:50",0,"speaker 1"
"We'll stop at.","02:29:51","02:29:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Go stop at line 95.","02:29:55","02:29:57",0,"speaker 1"
"So press D now.","02:30:01","02:30:06",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, we got zellage.","02:30:06","02:30:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I love it.","02:30:07","02:30:08",0,"speaker 1"
"MCP.","02:30:09","02:30:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, let's erase the MCP one.","02:30:10","02:30:13",0,"speaker 1"
"So 34D.","02:30:13","02:30:14",0,"speaker 1"
"You press DD to delete that line.","02:30:14","02:30:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Just DD.","02:30:16","02:30:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, that's weird.","02:30:21","02:30:25",0,"speaker 1"
"You won't need to fix the Zellage clipboard.","02:30:30","02:30:32",0,"speaker 1"
"So you can erase 34.","02:30:32","02:30:33",0,"speaker 1"
"You can double click it and then press D. Maybe that'll work.","02:30:34","02:30:37",0,"speaker 1"
"No, yeah.","02:30:38","02:30:41",0,"speaker 1"
"You shouldn't have to erase every letter.","02:30:41","02:30:43",0,"speaker 1"
"That's crazy.","02:30:43","02:30:45",0,"speaker 1"
"You can erase, dict, start, all that.","02:30:49","02:30:55",0,"speaker 1"
"That's for my voice control, which is cool, but we're not installing that now.","02:30:55","02:31:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You can erase that ascii Nema and the recording.","02:31:01","02:31:04",0,"speaker 1"
"You can keep all of that stuff below.","02:31:07","02:31:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So delete.","02:31:11","02:31:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Delete that.","02:31:12","02:31:12",0,"speaker 1"
"This is git.","02:31:13","02:31:14",0,"speaker 1"
"GitHub stuff, which is really good.","02:31:14","02:31:16",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you're into the GPT me stuff, which is very good.","02:31:16","02:31:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep going down, Keep going down.","02:31:20","02:31:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:31:35","02:31:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So MSA from line 88.","02:31:36","02:31:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Delete error down below that.","02:31:40","02:31:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","02:31:49","02:31:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep deleting.","02:31:49","02:31:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep deleting.","02:31:54","02:31:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep going, keep deleting all that SB stuff.","02:31:55","02:32:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You won't need that.","02:32:00","02:32:01",0,"speaker 1"
"And yeah, delete the entire rest of the file.","02:32:05","02:32:08",0,"speaker 1"
"I think that's the end of it.","02:32:09","02:32:11",1,"speaker 2"
"All the way to the end of the line.","02:32:12","02:32:13",0,"speaker 1"
"And D. Now let's go all the way to the top, just to make sure that we get the ones that we missed.","02:32:15","02:32:23",0,"speaker 1"
"For instance, all the homes.","02:32:26","02:32:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Homes this year.","02:32:31","02:32:31",0,"speaker 1"
"See, that's good.","02:32:31","02:32:32",0,"speaker 1"
"That's good.","02:32:33","02:32:33",0,"speaker 1"
"We're.","02:32:33","02:32:34",0,"speaker 1"
"No, the home is good.","02:32:34","02:32:35",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know what I'm talking about.","02:32:35","02:32:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So try this colon, like shift and the colon and the letter S. And then the percent symbol.","02:32:36","02:32:50",0,"speaker 1"
"And then slash.","02:32:53","02:32:55",0,"speaker 1"
"And then type the word code.","02:32:57","02:32:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And then a backslash, then a forward slash, and then now type.","02:33:05","02:33:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Repos are.","02:33:20","02:33:21",0,"speaker 1"
"No, type.","02:33:22","02:33:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Type, Erase repos.","02:33:26","02:33:30",0,"speaker 1"
"You need.","02:33:30","02:33:30",0,"speaker 1"
"You need something else.","02:33:30","02:33:31",0,"speaker 1"
"First you need a backslash and a dollar sign.","02:33:31","02:33:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Backslash, dollar sign.","02:33:39","02:33:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","02:33:44","02:33:44",0,"speaker 1"
"And then all caps, R E, P O.","02:33:44","02:33:47",0,"speaker 1"
"R E, P O, underscore.","02:33:49","02:33:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Path, all caps.","02:33:54","02:33:56",0,"speaker 1"
"And then a backslash and a forward slash, and then a forward slash, and then G, and then enter.","02:33:57","02:34:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Good luck on remembering that command.","02:34:22","02:34:26",1,"speaker 2"
"All right, so press colon again.","02:34:27","02:34:28",0,"speaker 1"
"We have to switch around, too.","02:34:29","02:34:30",0,"speaker 1"
"It yelled at us.","02:34:30","02:34:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Press colon.","02:34:31","02:34:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","02:34:35","02:34:35",0,"speaker 1"
"And now switch the two.","02:34:35","02:34:37",0,"speaker 1"
"See how it says S percent?","02:34:37","02:34:39",0,"speaker 1"
"It's percent S.","02:34:39","02:34:40",0,"speaker 1"
"How can.","02:34:43","02:34:43",1,"speaker 2"
"What?","02:34:45","02:34:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","02:34:46","02:34:46",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, no, no.","02:34:48","02:34:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Tab.","02:34:49","02:34:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Try that.","02:34:50","02:34:50",0,"speaker 1"
"No, go back.","02:34:52","02:34:53",0,"speaker 1"
"It should.","02:34:53","02:34:54",0,"speaker 1"
"There's no way it's showing you and not letting you.","02:34:54","02:34:56",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","02:34:56","02:34:56",0,"speaker 1"
"That's so stupid.","02:34:56","02:34:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Press the arrow forward.","02:34:57","02:34:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Forward arrow.","02:34:58","02:34:59",0,"speaker 1"
"I am doing it.","02:35:04","02:35:05",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, it's not.","02:35:05","02:35:05",0,"speaker 1"
"I see it.","02:35:08","02:35:08",0,"speaker 1"
"I can see it there.","02:35:08","02:35:10",0,"speaker 1"
"What'd you press the app up?","02:35:10","02:35:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so go back to the beginning and make it percent s, not s percent.","02:35:14","02:35:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, okay.","02:35:20","02:35:20",1,"speaker 2"
"Silly me.","02:35:21","02:35:22",0,"speaker 1"
"I forgot.","02:35:22","02:35:22",0,"speaker 1"
"I forgot it.","02:35:22","02:35:23",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","02:35:24","02:35:25",1,"speaker 2"
"Just press Enter.","02:35:26","02:35:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Huh?","02:35:30","02:35:31",1,"speaker 2"
"Well, that works in Vim vi.","02:35:32","02:35:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Neo.","02:35:35","02:35:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Vim.","02:35:35","02:35:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Why would they not make it work here?","02:35:36","02:35:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So stupid.","02:35:38","02:35:39",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, maybe they made it easier.","02:35:39","02:35:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So do the colon and do try to do find.","02:35:41","02:35:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there a find Replace.","02:35:44","02:35:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe type replace.","02:35:47","02:35:48",0,"speaker 1"
"You have to.","02:35:58","02:35:58",1,"speaker 2"
"How to find replace Regex in Helix, if they have a whole.","02:36:01","02:36:13",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, it is.","02:36:13","02:36:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, control H. Or you can do colon S Enter.","02:36:15","02:36:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Colon S, enter.","02:36:26","02:36:28",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","02:36:31","02:36:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, colon S. But without the dollar sign.","02:36:34","02:36:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Like the same line that we did.","02:36:37","02:36:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Just get rid of the percent.","02:36:39","02:36:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So go up, up should be in there.","02:36:41","02:36:43",0,"speaker 1"
"There.","02:36:44","02:36:44",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase the percent and see if it works.","02:36:44","02:36:47",0,"speaker 1"
"No, it didn't do.","02:36:50","02:36:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Didn't yell at you.","02:36:53","02:36:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I did.","02:36:56","02:36:57",1,"speaker 2"
"See?","02:36:57","02:36:57",1,"speaker 2"
"So go up and see if the word code is replaced.","02:36:58","02:37:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go all the way to the top.","02:37:00","02:37:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait just a second.","02:37:03","02:37:04",1,"speaker 2"
"How can I. I am clicking the up arrow.","02:37:06","02:37:14",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, you gotta erase.","02:37:14","02:37:15",0,"speaker 1"
"You got.","02:37:15","02:37:16",0,"speaker 1"
"You have some words in there, so you gotta erase them.","02:37:16","02:37:18",0,"speaker 1"
"I am.","02:37:19","02:37:20",1,"speaker 2"
"Escape.","02:37:22","02:37:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Escape.","02:37:22","02:37:23",1,"speaker 2"
"There.","02:37:24","02:37:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Shift color.","02:37:26","02:37:28",1,"speaker 2"
"Huh?","02:37:28","02:37:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Huh?","02:37:28","02:37:29",0,"speaker 1"
"You can erase the slash G at the end too.","02:37:33","02:37:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Or not the slash just a G. Yeah.","02:37:38","02:37:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press enter, colon S. Okay, what.","02:37:43","02:37:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Command are we trying to.","02:37:48","02:37:50",1,"speaker 2"
"We're trying to learn here.","02:37:51","02:37:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Here's.","02:37:52","02:37:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Here's what.","02:37:53","02:37:53",0,"speaker 1"
"I'll show you the thing.","02:37:53","02:37:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Paste it here in Helix.","02:37:57","02:38:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Here's the multiple ways.","02:38:05","02:38:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Control F, control H or colon, then S in the format of colon S. Pattern replacement flags.","02:38:06","02:38:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So it is colon S, slash, and then the pattern, which was code slash, and then the slash replacement, which is the dollar sign repo pass and then the slash and then the flags G. G means global.","02:38:18","02:38:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So do it everywhere.","02:38:36","02:38:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Do it on every line.","02:38:37","02:38:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Am I typing?","02:38:44","02:38:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I didn't press enter.","02:38:45","02:38:46",0,"speaker 1"
"I was reading it to you.","02:38:48","02:38:49",0,"speaker 1"
"I didn't know it wasn't sent already.","02:38:49","02:38:51",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's colon S, slash.","02:38:55","02:38:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you typed it in.","02:38:58","02:38:59",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know why.","02:38:59","02:39:00",0,"speaker 1"
"I think it's because it did need that slash G at the end.","02:39:01","02:39:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, we're trying to do the replacement command.","02:39:05","02:39:08",1,"speaker 2"
"We're trying to replace all of the word code slash with the word Dollar sign, repo path slash, which we could have manually typed a thousand times already, but you don't learn anything by manually typing.","02:39:10","02:39:28",0,"speaker 1"
"So it says here.","02:39:31","02:39:32",1,"speaker 2"
"Wait just a second.","02:39:33","02:39:34",1,"speaker 2"
"Shift.","02:39:34","02:39:35",1,"speaker 2"
"I thought it worked the first one that you did.","02:39:37","02:39:39",0,"speaker 1"
"S. The old.","02:39:41","02:39:42",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep, the old word, which is code.","02:39:44","02:39:48",0,"speaker 1"
"But not just all the word code, because then cloud code is going to be replaced.","02:39:48","02:39:52",0,"speaker 1"
"We need to do code slash so it knows we're referring to the word code in context of a pass.","02:39:52","02:39:57",0,"speaker 1"
"The only time we care about the word code is when it's used in a path.","02:40:02","02:40:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","02:40:10","02:40:10",1,"speaker 2"
"We're going to replace the code slash forward into something else right into the.","02:40:11","02:40:16",1,"speaker 2"
"Into repo path with a dollar sign in front.","02:40:16","02:40:19",0,"speaker 1"
"With this one here.","02:40:22","02:40:24",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, with the dollar sign and repo path.","02:40:24","02:40:29",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, but it's.","02:40:30","02:40:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You see how that looks wrong?","02:40:31","02:40:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Because you need to escape the slashes, the dollar signs.","02:40:33","02:40:37",0,"speaker 1"
"There's a bunch of.","02:40:37","02:40:38",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","02:40:38","02:40:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Like you need to escape it with a backslash to make it make more sense.","02:40:39","02:40:46",0,"speaker 1"
"You could change all of those forward slashes with any character you want to make it not confusing.","02:40:47","02:40:52",0,"speaker 1"
"It's really bad in pads, so I would replace it with an up and down one, like a pipe or an at symbol or a pound sign.","02:40:52","02:41:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Anything you want.","02:41:03","02:41:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, pound looks good.","02:41:03","02:41:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Like the number symbol.","02:41:04","02:41:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Every single slash you see, replace it with a pound sign.","02:41:06","02:41:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Hello?","02:41:16","02:41:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes, I'm trying to search also.","02:41:17","02:41:21",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, I'm going to replace this.","02:41:22","02:41:25",1,"speaker 2"
"Slashes.","02:41:25","02:41:25",1,"speaker 2"
"You mean?","02:41:25","02:41:26",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, replace the slash.","02:41:27","02:41:28",0,"speaker 1"
"They're really delimiters and they could be anything we want.","02:41:28","02:41:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So make.","02:41:32","02:41:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Make the slash a number sign.","02:41:33","02:41:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So right now do a number sign.","02:41:37","02:41:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, yep.","02:41:39","02:41:40",0,"speaker 1"
"And the first one where it says S slash, that's a number sign too.","02:41:40","02:41:43",0,"speaker 1"
"See how it looks better?","02:41:47","02:41:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Because now we can see code.","02:41:48","02:41:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Slash is part of the path.","02:41:50","02:41:52",0,"speaker 1"
"And now repo path.","02:41:52","02:41:54",0,"speaker 1"
"We also want a slash there and then another pound sign.","02:41:54","02:41:57",0,"speaker 1"
"And now G for global.","02:42:01","02:42:02",0,"speaker 1"
"And that should.","02:42:03","02:42:03",0,"speaker 1"
"This should work.","02:42:03","02:42:04",0,"speaker 1"
"No lowercase g. Yeah.","02:42:07","02:42:09",0,"speaker 1"
"I think it should be S slash.","02:42:13","02:42:18",1,"speaker 2"
"Why do delimiters not work?","02:42:24","02:42:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Says no command in Helix, you cannot use delimiters other than slash if you wish to.","02:42:33","02:42:53",0,"speaker 1"
"For patterns with forward slashes, you must escape them.","02:42:54","02:42:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You could use character classes.","02:42:59","02:43:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Use character classes.","02:43:11","02:43:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, if searching for literal forward slashes.","02:43:18","02:43:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Slash, slash, old slash path.","02:43:29","02:43:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, that's so bad.","02:43:33","02:43:34",0,"speaker 1"
"So they're saying that the workaround is you could escaped the other ones.","02:43:35","02:43:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","02:43:42","02:43:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, did you still not get it to work?","02:43:42","02:43:44",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","02:43:46","02:43:46",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, try it.","02:43:55","02:43:57",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","02:43:59","02:43:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","02:43:59","02:43:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you're.","02:44:00","02:44:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay open.","02:44:00","02:44:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:44:09","02:44:09",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, maybe.","02:44:09","02:44:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you.","02:44:10","02:44:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you should use Sublime or Cursor or VS code.","02:44:12","02:44:17",0,"speaker 1"
"And then if you wanted to learn this, you adopt it slowly.","02:44:19","02:44:23",0,"speaker 1"
"It took me so long, and I had to use multiple editors for the first while because I would.","02:44:23","02:44:29",0,"speaker 1"
"I would.","02:44:29","02:44:29",0,"speaker 1"
"It would take too long.","02:44:29","02:44:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:44:32","02:44:32",1,"speaker 2"
"So I actually made a website that teaches VIM bindings for NVIM and I call it DubQ, like Dub.cu, but that's how much it's.","02:44:33","02:44:47",0,"speaker 1"
"It could be annoying.","02:44:47","02:44:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's percent s. Yeah, that should work.","02:44:48","02:44:52",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know why it's not working, but it wouldn't end Vim.","02:44:52","02:44:57",0,"speaker 1"
"So all I say is that Helix is annoying.","02:44:58","02:45:00",0,"speaker 1"
"I've never used Helix.","02:45:00","02:45:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Now I don't like it.","02:45:01","02:45:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, why go and take it?","02:45:03","02:45:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, who are you appealing to?","02:45:06","02:45:07",0,"speaker 1"
"You're not appealing to people that like VS code because they don't like this crap.","02:45:07","02:45:11",0,"speaker 1"
"And the people that like NVIM are going to complain that it's not doing the complex regex.","02:45:11","02:45:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, who are they trying to appeal to?","02:45:16","02:45:18",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","02:45:18","02:45:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Those new kids.","02:45:21","02:45:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Ugh.","02:45:22","02:45:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Percent s. Slash code.","02:45:27","02:45:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Try it with a simple thing like replace the word alias with poop and see if it works.","02:45:30","02:45:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So, yeah, type code.","02:45:36","02:45:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Slash.","02:45:37","02:45:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Now type something else, like birds.","02:45:38","02:45:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Slash G. No, you need the end slash.","02:45:41","02:45:49",0,"speaker 1"
"And it doesn't like the percent, remember?","02:45:50","02:45:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Because for some reason they got rid of the percent.","02:45:52","02:45:55",0,"speaker 1"
"So get rid of percent.","02:45:57","02:45:58",0,"speaker 1"
"And at the end, you need slash G for the flags.","02:45:58","02:46:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Now try it.","02:46:02","02:46:02",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, I got nothing.","02:46:06","02:46:07",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know why it's not working.","02:46:07","02:46:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, don't know, don't care.","02:46:12","02:46:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Stupid.","02:46:15","02:46:15",0,"speaker 1"
"It's okay.","02:46:17","02:46:17",1,"speaker 2"
"Maybe we.","02:46:17","02:46:18",1,"speaker 2"
"Let's break it for now.","02:46:18","02:46:20",1,"speaker 2"
"I mean, I like how you want to keep doing it.","02:46:20","02:46:23",0,"speaker 1"
"That's.","02:46:23","02:46:23",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, that's amazing.","02:46:23","02:46:24",0,"speaker 1"
"I like.","02:46:24","02:46:25",0,"speaker 1"
"You understand, like, if this was anyone else, like, Gershon would be like, oh, okay, I'm out, like, instantly.","02:46:25","02:46:30",0,"speaker 1"
"But you're still thinking about how to get it.","02:46:30","02:46:32",0,"speaker 1"
"That's.","02:46:32","02:46:32",0,"speaker 1"
"That means you're going to be good at this.","02:46:32","02:46:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Go.","02:46:34","02:46:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Where did.","02:46:35","02:46:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Hey, where did it go?","02:46:35","02:46:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Are you done?","02:46:36","02:46:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, no, I think I'm thinking.","02:46:38","02:46:41",1,"speaker 2"
"No, I'm just worried that I'm taking too much of your time.","02:46:41","02:46:44",1,"speaker 2"
"No, I'm gonna be working until, like, until midnight.","02:46:45","02:46:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","02:46:50","02:46:51",1,"speaker 2"
"And I think the value of being able to show Gershon that you can type something into Claude is important.","02:46:53","02:47:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, and for everyone else, like, that would excite everybody.","02:47:00","02:47:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, oh, wow, Janine's doing it.","02:47:03","02:47:05",0,"speaker 1"
"I want to do it.","02:47:06","02:47:06",0,"speaker 1"
"You know?","02:47:06","02:47:07",0,"speaker 1"
"And also, all of this stuff that I'm learning doing with you, I will incorporate into the automatic happening.","02:47:08","02:47:15",0,"speaker 1"
"You know, the automatic scripting of it.","02:47:15","02:47:18",0,"speaker 1"
"We're trying to replace.","02:47:25","02:47:28",1,"speaker 2"
"Decode.","02:47:30","02:47:31",1,"speaker 2"
"The word code.","02:47:33","02:47:33",0,"speaker 1"
"The word code into this thing.","02:47:34","02:47:38",1,"speaker 2"
"Because I'm asking Chat GPT.","02:47:38","02:47:41",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, I'm gonna call Helix too.","02:47:41","02:47:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I want to.","02:47:45","02:47:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I want Helix.","02:47:45","02:47:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's do it.","02:47:46","02:47:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So I can yell at it.","02:47:48","02:47:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's see.","02:47:50","02:47:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Could not get locked.","02:48:02","02:48:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Who is am I installing?","02:48:03","02:48:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, yeah, I have updates.","02:48:07","02:48:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","02:48:09","02:48:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Stupid settings update.","02:48:10","02:48:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it.","02:48:33","02:48:33",1,"speaker 2"
"It's saying that Helix won't expand.","02:48:33","02:48:43",1,"speaker 2"
"I think this is the one you.","02:48:43","02:48:45",1,"speaker 2"
"You already said earlier it won't expand.","02:48:45","02:48:48",1,"speaker 2"
"Expand the repo path automatically.","02:48:48","02:48:51",1,"speaker 2"
"So we have to manually do it.","02:48:51","02:48:54",1,"speaker 2"
"No, no, no.","02:48:56","02:48:57",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't want it.","02:48:57","02:48:58",0,"speaker 1"
"See that.","02:48:58","02:48:59",0,"speaker 1"
"That's why GPT is stupid.","02:48:59","02:49:00",0,"speaker 1"
"We do not.","02:49:00","02:49:01",0,"speaker 1"
"We don't want to expand it.","02:49:01","02:49:04",0,"speaker 1"
"We want to.","02:49:04","02:49:05",0,"speaker 1"
"We want to verbatim literally replace those characters non expanded.","02:49:05","02:49:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Which is why we need to escape the dollar sign.","02:49:10","02:49:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Because ChatGPT thinks what we're trying to do here is replace the word code with whatever the contents of the variable repo pass.","02:49:19","02:49:27",0,"speaker 1"
"But that's not true at all.","02:49:27","02:49:29",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, let's try this code.","02:49:30","02:49:36",1,"speaker 2"
"Like that.","02:49:40","02:49:41",1,"speaker 2"
"And then.","02:49:42","02:49:43",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, sorry.","02:49:44","02:49:44",1,"speaker 2"
"Ripple path.","02:49:46","02:49:49",1,"speaker 2"
"G.","02:49:50","02:49:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Dude, you're not gonna believe this.","02:50:22","02:50:23",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","02:50:25","02:50:25",1,"speaker 2"
"I'm installing it now and I'm like, how come she didn't do this?","02:50:27","02:50:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Because you didn't do this.","02:50:41","02:50:42",0,"speaker 1"
"You installed it as a Windows app using winget.","02:50:45","02:50:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And then went through all that trouble.","02:50:47","02:50:49",0,"speaker 1"
"But this runs in Linux.","02:50:49","02:50:51",0,"speaker 1"
"You should have installed the Linux version.","02:50:51","02:50:53",0,"speaker 1"
"And we edit in Linux and we don't even cross over into Windows, which is awesome.","02:50:53","02:50:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Which makes it just as good as nvim.","02:50:57","02:50:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Except that, you know, NVIM is better, but.","02:50:59","02:51:03",0,"speaker 1"
"So I press Enter and it goes packages installed, reading list, no package Helix.","02:51:06","02:51:12",0,"speaker 1"
"But there is a snap with that name.","02:51:13","02:51:15",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't want a snap.","02:51:15","02:51:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, build the Debian file.","02:51:18","02:51:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Can we just download the Debian?","02:51:21","02:51:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Let me see.","02:51:23","02:51:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Download Debian file.","02:51:27","02:51:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Ugh, I just don't want to use Snap.","02:51:30","02:51:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Appimage.","02:51:36","02:51:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Install Helix using appimage.","02:51:37","02:51:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","02:51:40","02:51:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, go to the releases page.","02:51:41","02:51:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's try that here.","02:51:42","02:51:47",0,"speaker 1"

"The latest one right here.","02:51:53","02:51:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Linux x64.","02:51:57","02:51:59",0,"speaker 1"

"I think I already did that.","02:56:15","02:56:17",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","02:56:18","02:56:18",0,"speaker 1"

"Okay.","02:57:20","02:57:21",1,"speaker 2"
"All right.","02:57:22","02:57:23",1,"speaker 2"

"The one you taught me, the V. Right.","02:57:58","02:58:00",1,"speaker 2"
"So just a second.","02:58:00","02:58:03",1,"speaker 2"
"So escape V. Wait, this is.","02:58:04","02:58:09",1,"speaker 2"

"Oh, export.","02:58:13","02:58:14",0,"speaker 1"
"No, the one that if I.","02:58:15","02:58:18",1,"speaker 2"
"If I press V, then I'm able to select.","02:58:20","02:58:23",1,"speaker 2"
"All right.","02:58:23","02:58:24",1,"speaker 2"
"No, you should.","02:58:24","02:58:27",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","02:58:27","02:58:27",0,"speaker 1"
"If you press V, as long as you press escape, make sure you're escaped.","02:58:27","02:58:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You press V and then arrows.","02:58:31","02:58:33",0,"speaker 1"

"You press V. Yeah.","02:58:38","02:58:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait just a second.","02:58:44","02:58:45",1,"speaker 2"
"I wanted to show you how I did it, but I was keeping I am escaping.","02:58:45","02:58:51",1,"speaker 2"
"And then press V. All right, There you go.","02:58:51","02:58:54",1,"speaker 2"
"I have to highlight all of this.","02:58:56","02:58:59",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, was it not possible?","02:59:01","02:59:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","02:59:03","02:59:04",1,"speaker 2"
"And then it says that I should press S. And then this should search and then enter.","02:59:05","02:59:15",1,"speaker 2"
"And then you should type C. And for example, we find that particular keyword and then that's the time after you press C, type in the word that you wanted to replace it with.","02:59:17","02:59:33",1,"speaker 2"
"I know what you're saying, but it didn't work that time because you already got rid of code, so it didn't highlight.","02:59:33","02:59:39",0,"speaker 1"
"That's so weird.","02:59:40","02:59:41",0,"speaker 1"
"I hate it.","02:59:42","02:59:43",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't like that.","02:59:43","02:59:44",0,"speaker 1"

"Now.","02:59:50","02:59:51",0,"speaker 1"
"How can I undo that?","02:59:54","02:59:55",1,"speaker 2"
"How can you escape?","02:59:56","02:59:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, did you just.","02:59:57","03:00:00",0,"speaker 1"
"I can't undo that.","03:00:00","03:00:01",1,"speaker 2"

"V, for example.","03:00:15","03:00:17",1,"speaker 2"
"So for example, this one and then S. So I'm going to select the home because I wanted to get rid of it, for example, and then enter it didn't work.","03:00:17","03:00:35",1,"speaker 2"
"I don't know why.","03:00:35","03:00:36",1,"speaker 2"

"Oh, that's it.","03:01:54","03:01:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so you are going to run this and it goes directly into your dot config.","03:01:56","03:02:04",0,"speaker 1"
"It'll just put it in there.","03:02:04","03:02:05",0,"speaker 1"

"In your Linux?","03:02:28","03:02:29",0,"speaker 1"
"No, not PowerShell.","03:02:29","03:02:30",0,"speaker 1"

"I don't know why we're in there.","03:03:03","03:03:04",0,"speaker 1"
"We were in there because we installed that thing on your Windows, but we didn't need to and whatever.","03:03:04","03:03:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's do it right now because that's incorrect.","03:03:10","03:03:12",0,"speaker 1"
"This is what you want to do?","03:03:14","03:03:15",0,"speaker 1"

"Oh, yeah, we don't need to do that.","03:05:01","03:05:02",0,"speaker 1"
"You did the git clone for the starter.","03:05:02","03:05:04",0,"speaker 1"

"All right, so this is install from download.","03:06:05","03:06:07",0,"speaker 1"
"You're on Linux x64.","03:06:07","03:06:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, just downloaded it.","03:06:11","03:06:13",0,"speaker 1"
"So I'm going to give you this link and then you can just paste it in.","03:06:14","03:06:19",0,"speaker 1"
"And here.","03:06:28","03:06:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Make that the PLD Slackware Snap Ubuntu.","03:06:31","03:06:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's not.","03:06:35","03:06:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So I'm going to give you the link.","03:06:39","03:06:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Right click Copy.","03:06:47","03:06:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Here, paste.","03:06:49","03:06:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So type in.","03:06:53","03:06:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Where are you?","03:06:58","03:06:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, go to your Linux terminal.","03:06:58","03:07:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:07:09","03:07:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Now type W. Get.","03:07:09","03:07:12",0,"speaker 1"
"If you type wget space and then paste enter.","03:07:12","03:07:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","03:07:22","03:07:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you should have it downloaded and we're going to unzip it.","03:07:22","03:07:26",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","03:07:26","03:07:26",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's.","03:07:27","03:07:31",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm trying to think if you should back up a directory or not.","03:07:34","03:07:36",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's type TAR T A, R space X. I'm sorry, zxf space and then just press tab.","03:07:37","03:07:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Zxf and then tab space tab.","03:08:00","03:08:03",1,"speaker 2"
"It should just.","03:08:03","03:08:04",0,"speaker 1"
"The only.","03:08:05","03:08:05",0,"speaker 1"
"There's only one tar, so select that tar like Tab There, enter.","03:08:05","03:08:13",0,"speaker 1"
"That means the Z means unzip it first.","03:08:16","03:08:19",0,"speaker 1"
"The X means extract the tar, and the F means here's your file.","03:08:19","03:08:22",0,"speaker 1"
"So press enter.","03:08:22","03:08:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you should have a directory called nvim, Linux, whatever.","03:08:25","03:08:30",0,"speaker 1"
"So just to make sure we're just doing LS to make sure everything's cool, we have a directory, so cd Internet directory.","03:08:30","03:08:40",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm very curious.","03:08:40","03:08:41",0,"speaker 1"
"What's in there?","03:08:41","03:08:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Just tab enter LS so we can see what is in there.","03:08:45","03:08:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Bin lib Share.","03:08:55","03:08:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","03:08:58","03:08:58",0,"speaker 1"
"So we want to back up one directory.","03:08:58","03:09:03",0,"speaker 1"
"So CD space, dot, dot.","03:09:03","03:09:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:09:15","03:09:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we're going to move.","03:09:16","03:09:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So type M as in Mary V Space, type nvim Tab just so we can get into that.","03:09:19","03:09:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Right?","03:09:31","03:09:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:09:31","03:09:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Tab.","03:09:32","03:09:33",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","03:09:37","03:09:37",0,"speaker 1"
"No, you want.","03:09:39","03:09:40",0,"speaker 1"
"You want the directory.","03:09:40","03:09:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So backup one space, slash.","03:09:41","03:09:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, Now.","03:09:45","03:09:46",0,"speaker 1"
"No, that was right.","03:09:46","03:09:47",0,"speaker 1"
"That was right.","03:09:47","03:09:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Tab, Tab.","03:09:48","03:09:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, there you go.","03:09:51","03:09:52",0,"speaker 1"
"There you go.","03:09:52","03:09:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Now type bin tab.","03:09:52","03:09:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Now tab again and we should see the executable.","03:09:59","03:10:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Now what we want to do is we're going to move that into your local path.","03:10:02","03:10:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So type tilde, which is next to the number one.","03:10:05","03:10:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:10:09","03:10:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Slash, dot, local slash, bin slash.","03:10:10","03:10:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press enter.","03:10:25","03:10:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we got to press up and just do that for.","03:10:27","03:10:30",0,"speaker 1"
"There's a share.","03:10:30","03:10:30",0,"speaker 1"
"So go back to where it says nvim bim.","03:10:31","03:10:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase nvim N bin and you're going to type nope, erase the bin.","03:10:33","03:10:41",0,"speaker 1"
"The bin was one of the three things in that tar.","03:10:41","03:10:43",0,"speaker 1"
"So there was also a share.","03:10:43","03:10:45",0,"speaker 1"
"So type share or S Tab.","03:10:45","03:10:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, Tab twice so we can see what's in there.","03:10:47","03:10:50",0,"speaker 1"
"So I think that there's a more idiomatic way to do this instead of doing all of.","03:10:52","03:11:13",0,"speaker 1"
"I didn't realize there would be four of them, but Tab into applications.","03:11:13","03:11:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Whoops.","03:11:19","03:11:20",0,"speaker 1"
"And see what's in there.","03:11:21","03:11:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Hopefully it says like nvim or something.","03:11:26","03:11:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go over to the right side where it says bin and replace that with share.","03:11:29","03:11:36",0,"speaker 1"
"And hopefully there's an applications there.","03:11:37","03:11:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So tab.","03:11:39","03:11:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there an applications?","03:11:40","03:11:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Well, there's the nvim.","03:11:43","03:11:44",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to do that later.","03:11:45","03:11:46",0,"speaker 1"
"That's good.","03:11:48","03:11:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Now erase nvim.","03:11:49","03:11:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that.","03:11:50","03:11:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Go all the way back to where it says nvim Desktop.","03:11:52","03:11:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, erase that.","03:12:01","03:12:02",0,"speaker 1"
"We're just going to copy the entire share directory because, like, the entire app because.","03:12:03","03:12:08",0,"speaker 1"
"No, no, erase that.","03:12:08","03:12:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Go, erase that, erase that.","03:12:10","03:12:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Go backwards back.","03:12:11","03:12:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, don't erase that.","03:12:12","03:12:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Keep the slash.","03:12:13","03:12:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press the arrow button.","03:12:16","03:12:18",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to erase the word application.","03:12:18","03:12:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Nven desktop.","03:12:21","03:12:22",0,"speaker 1"
"I am pressing the up and down button.","03:12:25","03:12:27",1,"speaker 2"
"Nope, nope.","03:12:27","03:12:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Left, left.","03:12:28","03:12:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, yep.","03:12:32","03:12:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:12:33","03:12:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Now erase desktop nvim, erase that, erase applications and type star.","03:12:33","03:12:44",0,"speaker 1"
"So we're going to move everything in the share.","03:12:45","03:12:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press enter.","03:12:47","03:12:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","03:12:51","03:12:52",0,"speaker 1"
"And I think there was one more directory, but I don't remember what it was called.","03:12:52","03:12:55",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, there it is.","03:12:56","03:12:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Lib.","03:12:57","03:12:58",0,"speaker 1"
"See?","03:12:58","03:12:58",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's copy that.","03:12:59","03:13:01",0,"speaker 1"
"So press up and erase the word share and change it to lib.","03:13:01","03:13:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Now I have a feeling you don't even have a lib.","03:13:12","03:13:14",0,"speaker 1"
"But let's see.","03:13:14","03:13:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Go to the end and see if there's a lib to the right side and erase share.","03:13:15","03:13:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there a lib?","03:13:21","03:13:22",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","03:13:23","03:13:23",0,"speaker 1"
"So just copy.","03:13:23","03:13:24",0,"speaker 1"
"All you gotta do is erase the star and we're gonna copy and erase the path thing we want.","03:13:25","03:13:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","03:13:33","03:13:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Lib.","03:13:34","03:13:34",0,"speaker 1"
"We wanna copy lib or move it to local.","03:13:35","03:13:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So.","03:13:40","03:13:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So press enter.","03:13:40","03:13:41",0,"speaker 1"
"All right.","03:13:46","03:13:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you should have the new upgraded nvim.","03:13:46","03:13:48",0,"speaker 1"
"I hope.","03:13:48","03:13:49",0,"speaker 1"
"So type which nvim to make sure it's going to be using the right one.","03:13:49","03:13:54",0,"speaker 1"
"So which W H I C H space.","03:13:54","03:13:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Nvim.","03:13:59","03:14:00",0,"speaker 1"
"See, that's the wrong one.","03:14:04","03:14:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So what we need is to promote your local bin.","03:14:05","03:14:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So type zzz.","03:14:10","03:14:14",0,"speaker 1"
"I think the aliases are now working.","03:14:15","03:14:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Are they?","03:14:17","03:14:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, we didn't update your zishrc.","03:14:19","03:14:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Press enter.","03:14:21","03:14:22",0,"speaker 1"
"It's probably not going to work.","03:14:22","03:14:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","03:14:24","03:14:25",0,"speaker 1"
"So type vi space.","03:14:25","03:14:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, not vi.","03:14:29","03:14:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Nvim.","03:14:31","03:14:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry, that's right.","03:14:32","03:14:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Nvim space.","03:14:34","03:14:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Tilde, slash, dot.","03:14:38","03:14:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Zishrc.","03:14:40","03:14:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Awesome.","03:14:45","03:14:45",0,"speaker 1"
"Zshrc.","03:14:46","03:14:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, there's no Zishi.","03:14:50","03:14:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Zishi is.","03:14:51","03:14:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, no, what did I do?","03:14:54","03:14:58",1,"speaker 2"
"It's installing it to the wrong NVIM now because we didn't update it.","03:14:59","03:15:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh my God.","03:15:03","03:15:04",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, okay.","03:15:04","03:15:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Press kiki.","03:15:05","03:15:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Is there a Q to get out?","03:15:08","03:15:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Press colon.","03:15:11","03:15:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Q Escape.","03:15:12","03:15:13",0,"speaker 1"
"I am escaping Colon.","03:15:14","03:15:18",1,"speaker 2"
"Can you press colon Q?","03:15:18","03:15:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Like type in A. Oh, no.","03:15:20","03:15:25",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm in a different dimension.","03:15:29","03:15:30",1,"speaker 2"
"Colon Q.","03:15:31","03:15:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Just open a new tab.","03:15:37","03:15:39",0,"speaker 1"
"Open a new ubuntu.","03:15:39","03:15:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Forget this thing.","03:15:40","03:15:40",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","03:15:41","03:15:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh yeah.","03:15:42","03:15:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, now you can.","03:15:43","03:15:44",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","03:15:44","03:15:45",1,"speaker 2"
"Go back.","03:15:45","03:15:46",0,"speaker 1"
"I just saw something.","03:15:46","03:15:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now do a colon.","03:15:46","03:15:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Now it won't let you call.","03:15:47","03:15:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I see it lit up.","03:15:51","03:15:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Now.","03:15:52","03:15:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Q enter and colon Q again.","03:15:52","03:16:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Q enter lower.","03:16:06","03:16:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, there.","03:16:08","03:16:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, I don't know what it did there, but that's.","03:16:09","03:16:12",0,"speaker 1"
"That's fine.","03:16:12","03:16:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Now nvim zshrc without the Y.","03:16:13","03:16:17",0,"speaker 1"
"The sh.","03:16:18","03:16:19",1,"speaker 2"
"Rc.","03:16:21","03:16:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, try that.","03:16:23","03:16:25",0,"speaker 1"
"No, no, it's Z and then sh for.","03:16:25","03:16:30",0,"speaker 1"
"That's Z shell.","03:16:30","03:16:32",0,"speaker 1"
"And then RC is like the name for our settings file.","03:16:32","03:16:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's like there's lots of RCs.","03:16:35","03:16:38",0,"speaker 1"
"There's like a bash RC.","03:16:38","03:16:39",0,"speaker 1"
"There's a.","03:16:40","03:16:40",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","03:16:40","03:16:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's a V shell rc.","03:16:41","03:16:43",0,"speaker 1"
"That's how I remember it.","03:16:43","03:16:44",0,"speaker 1"
"So now enter.","03:16:45","03:16:45",0,"speaker 1"
"That looks good.","03:16:45","03:16:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now what's happening now?","03:16:53","03:16:55",1,"speaker 2"
"This is very strange.","03:16:55","03:16:57",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know why.","03:16:57","03:16:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Colon Q to get out.","03:16:58","03:16:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Pretty sure you typed it right.","03:17:03","03:17:04",0,"speaker 1"
"You can't colon Q get out.","03:17:05","03:17:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I cannot shift.","03:17:08","03:17:10",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, okay.","03:17:10","03:17:10",1,"speaker 2"
"I think it did something.","03:17:13","03:17:14",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, it's because we're using the wrong NVIM still.","03:17:15","03:17:18",0,"speaker 1"
"But we're going to fix that in a sec because now press enter to get out of that.","03:17:18","03:17:23",0,"speaker 1"
"It's trying to do all these things.","03:17:23","03:17:25",0,"speaker 1"
"It's trying to.","03:17:25","03:17:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","03:17:28","03:17:28",0,"speaker 1"
"This is because it's using the wrong nvim.","03:17:28","03:17:31",0,"speaker 1"
"NVM isn't updated yet.","03:17:31","03:17:33",0,"speaker 1"
"So type hx.","03:17:33","03:17:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's use our old buddy hx Tilde dot.","03:17:35","03:17:39",0,"speaker 1"
"No, gotta tell it.","03:17:39","03:17:42",0,"speaker 1"
"The file quit.","03:17:42","03:17:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, quit that.","03:17:46","03:17:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And now press up and then just erase the up.","03:17:47","03:17:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Press up again there.","03:17:52","03:17:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase NVIM and replace it with HX enter.","03:17:53","03:17:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go down to the right.","03:18:02","03:18:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, wait.","03:18:07","03:18:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Stop.","03:18:07","03:18:08",0,"speaker 1"
"It's right.","03:18:08","03:18:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Right?","03:18:09","03:18:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh no, you're going too far.","03:18:09","03:18:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Come on.","03:18:10","03:18:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Stop this.","03:18:11","03:18:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Random case sensitive hyphen.","03:18:12","03:18:16",0,"speaker 1"

"Zsh.","03:21:29","03:21:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Zsh.","03:21:31","03:21:31",0,"speaker 1"

"That's correct so far.","03:21:43","03:21:44",0,"speaker 1"
"And now zsh.","03:21:44","03:21:46",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's the word zish and then the word zish again with the Y in the middle.","03:21:47","03:21:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope.","03:21:55","03:21:56",0,"speaker 1"

"Z shell.","03:22:33","03:22:34",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, if it was H, then it would be Z has sh.","03:22:34","03:22:36",0,"speaker 1"

"Should be just aliases.","03:36:40","03:36:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","03:36:41","03:36:42",0,"speaker 1"
"So pick the first one.","03:36:42","03:36:43",0,"speaker 1"
"That's it.","03:36:47","03:36:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Open that.","03:36:47","03:36:48",0,"speaker 1"

"The bottom one is the one we're on.","03:36:52","03:36:54",0,"speaker 1"
"And so far that looks good.","03:36:56","03:37:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You just press down to move down.","03:37:01","03:37:03",0,"speaker 1"
"You shouldn't have.","03:37:04","03:37:05",0,"speaker 1"
"You're on the bottom one.","03:37:07","03:37:08",0,"speaker 1"
"That's where.","03:37:09","03:37:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So you're confined to the bottom half right now until you press something weird.","03:37:11","03:37:15",0,"speaker 1"
"So I thought we erased those.","03:37:15","03:37:16",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's just erase them.","03:37:16","03:37:18",0,"speaker 1"
"The quick access defaults.","03:37:19","03:37:20",0,"speaker 1"
"I thought we erased.","03:37:20","03:37:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, maybe we didn't save at all.","03:37:21","03:37:24",1,"speaker 2"
"Maybe, dude.","03:37:25","03:37:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes, that's the problem.","03:37:30","03:37:31",0,"speaker 1"
"We did a whole bunch of work, never saved it.","03:37:32","03:37:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Is it still open in one of your tabs?","03:37:34","03:37:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry?","03:37:39","03:37:40",0,"speaker 1"

"I'm not sure anymore.","03:37:48","03:37:49",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, this one?","03:37:49","03:37:50",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, that's it.","03:37:53","03:37:54",0,"speaker 1"
"So here's what we're going to do.","03:37:55","03:37:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Go to the correct one, the one that was in the helix.","03:37:56","03:37:58",0,"speaker 1"
"I think that's what's causing all this problem.","03:37:58","03:38:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Open that terminal window.","03:38:00","03:38:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:38:02","03:38:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Open the kind of purpley one.","03:38:02","03:38:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Now what you want to do is save this.","03:38:05","03:38:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Because we did a lot of work.","03:38:06","03:38:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's save it.","03:38:07","03:38:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So press escape, colon wq.","03:38:08","03:38:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:38:14","03:38:15",0,"speaker 1"

"Yep.","03:38:30","03:38:30",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep, that looks correct now, except for the one problem of having totally incorrect exports right there.","03:38:33","03:38:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So what you want to do is erase home.","03:38:41","03:38:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:38:46","03:38:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And the slash.","03:38:47","03:38:48",0,"speaker 1"
"And the slash.","03:38:49","03:38:50",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah, because the slash is baked into the press.","03:38:51","03:38:54",0,"speaker 1"
"no.","03:38:54","03:38:56",0,"speaker 1"
"FG foreground fg.","03:38:56","03:38:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Bring it back.","03:38:58","03:38:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Enter.","03:38:59","03:39:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Now just press U to undo.","03:39:01","03:39:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Now press I to turn it into a flat cursor, which means you can edit.","03:39:05","03:39:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Press I.","03:39:11","03:39:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you can edit.","03:39:12","03:39:13",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase that.","03:39:14","03:39:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Now go down.","03:39:16","03:39:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase the slash, the home.","03:39:17","03:39:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, there you go.","03:39:20","03:39:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, as soon as you're done, I press Escape to go back to the square.","03:39:21","03:39:24",0,"speaker 1"
"There.","03:39:26","03:39:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Now you're back to commands and everything.","03:39:26","03:39:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Trinet, Legacy.","03:39:28","03:39:29",0,"speaker 1"
"That's fine, that's good.","03:39:29","03:39:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Above that, we need to set the repo path.","03:39:31","03:39:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Press 00.","03:39:35","03:39:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait a minute, are we split screen here?","03:39:40","03:39:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:39:43","03:39:44",1,"speaker 2"
"You want to go.","03:39:46","03:39:47",0,"speaker 1"
"We know the problem is no longer this file.","03:39:49","03:39:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's get out of here.","03:39:51","03:39:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's do colon Q to get out of the top.","03:39:52","03:39:54",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't think we change anything.","03:39:56","03:39:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You can just Queue.","03:39:58","03:39:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, how am I sure that.","03:40:00","03:40:03",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, it'll yell at you if you didn't save.","03:40:03","03:40:05",0,"speaker 1"
"What did you do it?","03:40:08","03:40:09",0,"speaker 1"
"You press enter?","03:40:09","03:40:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Yes.","03:40:12","03:40:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Why is it still open?","03:40:12","03:40:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Colon Q.","03:40:17","03:40:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, I think you're.","03:40:22","03:40:23",1,"speaker 2"
"Do you have cap locks on or something?","03:40:23","03:40:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Like, what's going on?","03:40:25","03:40:26",0,"speaker 1"
"No, no, you're just the wrong click.","03:40:28","03:40:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Cancel.","03:40:34","03:40:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Cancel.","03:40:35","03:40:35",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know what you did now.","03:40:35","03:40:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, you're on the aliases.","03:40:38","03:40:40",0,"speaker 1"
"We want to close that zishrc file.","03:40:40","03:40:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's make sure it's closed.","03:40:42","03:40:43",0,"speaker 1"
"So to get to the other one, you can press control.","03:40:43","03:40:46",0,"speaker 1"
"WW Control.","03:40:48","03:40:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Ww.","03:40:51","03:40:51",1,"speaker 2"
"Yep, real fast.","03:40:52","03:40:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Are you holding control?","03:40:55","03:40:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Are you sure you're holding control when you do that?","03:40:56","03:40:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:40:58","03:40:59",1,"speaker 2"
"I think it's just one W. I don't think so.","03:41:01","03:41:06",1,"speaker 2"
"Try it.","03:41:09","03:41:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Try the one oh, W lowercase without pressing shift or q or anything.","03:41:09","03:41:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Try that.","03:41:14","03:41:14",0,"speaker 1"
"I mean, you could just click with your mouse.","03:41:18","03:41:20",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm just trying to learn how to do it.","03:41:20","03:41:21",0,"speaker 1"
"So you can click the tab at the top.","03:41:21","03:41:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, wait.","03:41:25","03:41:26",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay.","03:41:27","03:41:28",1,"speaker 2"
"Can you repeat that?","03:41:28","03:41:29",1,"speaker 2"
"Yes.","03:41:31","03:41:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So click the tab.","03:41:31","03:41:33",0,"speaker 1"
"See, you have two tabs.","03:41:34","03:41:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Alias is active.","03:41:35","03:41:36",0,"speaker 1"
"This RC is in the background.","03:41:36","03:41:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Click the ZishRC.","03:41:38","03:41:39",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to select.","03:41:40","03:41:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Great.","03:41:42","03:41:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we want to just close this one out perfectly without losing anything.","03:41:42","03:41:47",0,"speaker 1"
"So we're going to type colon and we're going to type Q.","03:41:47","03:41:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","03:41:52","03:41:53",1,"speaker 2"
"Wq.","03:41:56","03:41:57",1,"speaker 2"
"Well, we.","03:41:58","03:41:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","03:41:59","03:42:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Wq.","03:42:00","03:42:00",0,"speaker 1"
"You can try that.","03:42:00","03:42:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Read only is set.","03:42:04","03:42:06",0,"speaker 1"
"No.","03:42:08","03:42:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So press N. Now do contr colon, Q with an exclamation point.","03:42:08","03:42:18",0,"speaker 1"
"That means God damn quit.","03:42:20","03:42:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, why is it save changes?","03:42:22","03:42:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it's trying to quit everything.","03:42:25","03:42:27",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, so just say yes.","03:42:29","03:42:31",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know what the hell's going on.","03:42:31","03:42:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Just say yes.","03:42:32","03:42:33",0,"speaker 1"
"We want to get out of this whole session.","03:42:33","03:42:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, now it's saying this one is read only.","03:42:36","03:42:39",1,"speaker 2"
"It's because were editing two of them at the same time.","03:42:41","03:42:44",0,"speaker 1"
"This one is the crappy one.","03:42:45","03:42:47",0,"speaker 1"
"We do not want to save this.","03:42:47","03:42:48",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the backup.","03:42:48","03:42:50",0,"speaker 1"
"This is the one that we started editing when were like, something's wrong.","03:42:50","03:42:55",0,"speaker 1"
"So we want to quit this 100%.","03:42:55","03:42:58",0,"speaker 1"
"So do Q exclamation.","03:42:58","03:43:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Great.","03:43:02","03:43:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Now.","03:43:03","03:43:04",0,"speaker 1"
"Now we want to kill all MVIMs.","03:43:07","03:43:09",0,"speaker 1"
"So do a pseudo PK.","03:43:09","03:43:10",0,"speaker 1"
"No one word PKIL.","03:43:13","03:43:15",0,"speaker 1"
"What?","03:43:16","03:43:17",1,"speaker 2"
"One word PKIL no space.","03:43:17","03:43:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, okay.","03:43:19","03:43:20",1,"speaker 2"
"PKIL space, NVIM enter.","03:43:21","03:43:26",0,"speaker 1"
"It might ask you for a password.","03:43:27","03:43:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, now all the NVIMs are killed, even in the background.","03:43:28","03:43:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Whatever.","03:43:35","03:43:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So now hopefully stuff is fixed.","03:43:36","03:43:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's make sure your zishrc is still there.","03:43:39","03:43:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So LL or lsal.","03:43:41","03:43:45",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know if you have that alias.","03:43:46","03:43:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","03:43:49","03:43:49",1,"speaker 2"
"Ll should list everything in a tabular form.","03:43:51","03:43:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, it did.","03:43:55","03:43:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Cool.","03:43:56","03:43:57",0,"speaker 1"
"So now I know you're in the home directory, but you need to do ls space-al so we can see the hidden files.","03:43:57","03:44:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Al A is for all.","03:44:10","03:44:13",0,"speaker 1"
"L is for list form.","03:44:13","03:44:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, yep.","03:44:18","03:44:19",0,"speaker 1"
"And there's your sister.","03:44:21","03:44:23",0,"speaker 1"
"C. See, it's root.","03:44:23","03:44:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Root.","03:44:25","03:44:26",0,"speaker 1"
"That's why it's read only, because you were editing it as someone who was not used.","03:44:26","03:44:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So we got to change that back to you or it'll.","03:44:31","03:44:33",0,"speaker 1"
"You can't even open another terminal if it's that.","03:44:33","03:44:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So we're gonna do a cho A pseudo S U D O for to get super user access and then do ch O.","03:44:35","03:44:47",0,"speaker 1"
"That's for change.","03:44:49","03:44:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Like.","03:44:53","03:44:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:44:54","03:44:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Like change own.","03:44:54","03:44:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep.","03:44:57","03:44:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Change ownership.","03:44:57","03:44:58",0,"speaker 1"
"And now space you type ja colon.","03:44:58","03:45:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Ja.","03:45:02","03:45:03",0,"speaker 1"
"That means jaw should be the user and ja is the user group.","03:45:03","03:45:07",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you're going to press space and type.zish rc.","03:45:07","03:45:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Nope, zishrc.","03:45:16","03:45:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Not the thing that I made this use.","03:45:20","03:45:22",0,"speaker 1"
"This is just.","03:45:22","03:45:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, entertainment.","03:45:23","03:45:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","03:45:26","03:45:26",0,"speaker 1"
"So now that's it.","03:45:26","03:45:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Everything's fixed there.","03:45:29","03:45:30",0,"speaker 1"
"But that makes me wonder, is it selecting your custom file.","03:45:32","03:45:38",0,"speaker 1"
"So open the zishrc.","03:45:38","03:45:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Here you're going to learn a new command.","03:45:40","03:45:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Control R should put you in reverse set.","03:45:42","03:45:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Now just start typing VI See that?","03:45:46","03:45:53",0,"speaker 1"
"So now type I Vi.","03:45:53","03:45:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that, type vi now space.","03:45:59","03:46:02",0,"speaker 1"
"It's basically backwards searching through your history.","03:46:03","03:46:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So now you can just press enter super fast.","03:46:05","03:46:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Interesting.","03:46:10","03:46:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Look at this.","03:46:11","03:46:12",0,"speaker 1"
"It's still screwing this up.","03:46:12","03:46:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, but that's okay because I think if we made any changes that we needed to, we didn't reload the shell.","03:46:15","03:46:22",0,"speaker 1"
"So obviously it's going to be screwed up still.","03:46:22","03:46:24",0,"speaker 1"
"But let's see if at least it doesn't change back to root to get to the very bottom.","03:46:24","03:46:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Shift G there at the very bottom it is eval Home local.","03:46:31","03:46:41",0,"speaker 1"
"That looks great.","03:46:41","03:46:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Nothing is crazy there.","03:46:44","03:46:45",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's go up to make sure this custom folder is set.","03:46:45","03:46:49",0,"speaker 1"
"So scroll up a little.","03:46:49","03:46:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it looks like it's set.","03:46:50","03:46:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Is this custom?","03:46:52","03:46:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, wait, I don't see it anymore.","03:46:55","03:46:57",0,"speaker 1"
"I couldn't read it fast enough.","03:46:57","03:46:58",0,"speaker 1"
"This custom is home config.","03:47:02","03:47:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Great.","03:47:07","03:47:07",0,"speaker 1"
"That looks fine.","03:47:07","03:47:08",0,"speaker 1"
"This.","03:47:08","03:47:09",0,"speaker 1"
"She's this.","03:47:09","03:47:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Now,","03:47:10","03:47:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Go up a little to the blank line up there.","03:47:16","03:47:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Just wherever.","03:47:20","03:47:21",0,"speaker 1"
"It doesn't matter.","03:47:21","03:47:21",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to add a new export.","03:47:21","03:47:22",0,"speaker 1"
"So yeah, type I to start typing and we're going to do export and then nope, lowercase export and then space and all caps.","03:47:26","03:47:40",0,"speaker 1"
"ZC like C Z as in zebra, C as in carnival.","03:47:41","03:47:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","03:47:51","03:47:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Equals.","03:47:52","03:47:53",0,"speaker 1"
"And it's going to be home config Z issues.","03:47:55","03:47:57",0,"speaker 1"
"This uses this.","03:47:57","03:47:58",0,"speaker 1"
"So maybe you can just copy down there.","03:47:58","03:48:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","03:48:03","03:48:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Dot config.","03:48:06","03:48:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Great.","03:48:17","03:48:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, to be correct, really, I would go.","03:48:18","03:48:23",0,"speaker 1"
"And now replace that Zish custom with zc.","03:48:23","03:48:27",0,"speaker 1"
"So erase all up to the dollar sign.","03:48:27","03:48:30",0,"speaker 1"
"No, up to the dollar sign.","03:48:30","03:48:31",0,"speaker 1"
"You're going to replace dollar home with dollar zc.","03:48:33","03:48:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, just erase the whole thing.","03:48:36","03:48:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","03:48:42","03:48:42",0,"speaker 1"
"D.","03:48:42","03:48:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, come on.","03:48:45","03:48:46",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, let's keep.","03:48:46","03:48:47",1,"speaker 2"
"And then.","03:48:47","03:48:48",1,"speaker 2"
"Wait just a second.","03:48:49","03:48:50",1,"speaker 2"
"What?","03:48:54","03:48:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's annoying until you get used to it.","03:48:54","03:48:57",0,"speaker 1"
"And then when you do, you're like a speed God.","03:48:57","03:48:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So now ZC escape and escape.","03:49:00","03:49:06",0,"speaker 1"
"WQ to get out, or colon WQ rather.","03:49:06","03:49:09",0,"speaker 1"
"No compile.","03:49:14","03:49:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, that was the X.","03:49:15","03:49:16",0,"speaker 1"
"All right, we got a.","03:49:16","03:49:17",0,"speaker 1"
"That's maybe that's why it's taken so long.","03:49:17","03:49:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Remember, we had an X.","03:49:19","03:49:20",0,"speaker 1"
"It was an error.","03:49:20","03:49:21",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","03:49:22","03:49:23",1,"speaker 2"
"Press Enter.","03:49:23","03:49:24",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it'll get out of this thing.","03:49:24","03:49:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Control C to Control C or.","03:49:28","03:49:31",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, wait, no, no, no.","03:49:32","03:49:34",0,"speaker 1"
"You're still in nvim.","03:49:34","03:49:35",0,"speaker 1"
"So colon Q again.","03:49:35","03:49:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","03:49:39","03:49:40",0,"speaker 1"
"So that must be what the problem is.","03:49:40","03:49:42",0,"speaker 1"
"So let's stop that.","03:49:42","03:49:43",0,"speaker 1"

"But I've used like so many.","04:05:03","04:05:05",0,"speaker 1"
"There's so many good fonts.","04:05:05","04:05:06",0,"speaker 1"

"The one that everyone uses, the JetBrains one.","04:05:11","04:05:14",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","04:05:16","04:05:16",0,"speaker 1"

"There's the Jetbrains mono.","04:05:22","04:05:24",0,"speaker 1"
"When you're bored, you literally spend so long like, oh, this makes it look so cool.","04:05:25","04:05:30",0,"speaker 1"

"Use them everywhere.","04:05:32","04:05:33",0,"speaker 1"
"And the reason is some.","04:05:35","04:05:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Some font.","04:05:36","04:05:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Some of the characters don't show up correctly unless they're nerd fonts because they have the ligatures.","04:05:38","04:05:45",0,"speaker 1"
"And then you could check box all the checks in the settings and that always say ligatures and you can't select it.","04:05:46","04:05:52",0,"speaker 1"
"But now you can.","04:05:52","04:05:52",0,"speaker 1"
"So just download.","04:05:53","04:05:59",0,"speaker 1"
"How would you.","04:06:00","04:06:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you're going to need the ttf.","04:06:01","04:06:02",0,"speaker 1"
"That's right.","04:06:06","04:06:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Because Alkrit is installed on Windows, so.","04:06:06","04:06:08",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, perfect.","04:06:08","04:06:09",0,"speaker 1"

"All right, this is.","04:06:13","04:06:15",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay.","04:06:15","04:06:15",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","04:06:16","04:06:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Then you just open it and then it should.","04:06:19","04:06:22",0,"speaker 1"
"You need to click the main one and it should install all of them, which is.","04:06:22","04:06:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, wait, true type.","04:06:27","04:06:29",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","04:06:30","04:06:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So maybe you could select.","04:06:31","04:06:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe there's not an easy way.","04:06:34","04:06:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe you just have to like freaking click on each.","04:06:35","04:06:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So just click on install.","04:06:41","04:06:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Perfect.","04:06:46","04:06:46",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, that's it.","04:06:49","04:06:50",0,"speaker 1"
"It's annoying.","04:06:51","04:06:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Good thing that you had to do this because if you didn't, I might just install all of them and play with them all the time.","04:06:53","04:06:59",0,"speaker 1"
"I've never seen this.","04:07:01","04:07:01",0,"speaker 1"
"I've never tried this one.","04:07:01","04:07:02",0,"speaker 1"
"This one looks like old school, like an 80s kind of pixel.","04:07:02","04:07:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it's cool.","04:07:06","04:07:07",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","04:07:08","04:07:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So the one that you need most is any mono.","04:07:09","04:07:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Or else it's gonna look weird in the terminal, so it should.","04:07:12","04:07:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Nice, Nice.","04:07:20","04:07:21",0,"speaker 1"

"You're in program data.","04:11:34","04:11:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it's going to be in your app data in your home directory.","04:11:36","04:11:40",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what I'm thinking.","04:11:40","04:11:41",0,"speaker 1"
"So go to your users home.","04:11:44","04:11:48",0,"speaker 1"

"I think it's under program.","04:12:05","04:12:07",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, okay.","04:12:08","04:12:08",0,"speaker 1"

"Oh no, it's not.","04:12:10","04:12:11",1,"speaker 2"
"All right, then try roaming.","04:12:12","04:12:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it's roaming.","04:12:13","04:12:14",0,"speaker 1"
"Stupid Windows code gimp.","04:12:15","04:12:22",0,"speaker 1"

"Oh, it's roaming.","04:12:56","04:12:57",0,"speaker 1"
"It's typically users jaw appdata roaming Alacrity App data roaming.","04:12:57","04:13:06",0,"speaker 1"

"Yeah.","04:13:09","04:13:10",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, so what I'm going to say is.","04:13:10","04:13:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, let's say it's not.","04:13:12","04:13:16",0,"speaker 1"
"How am I expected to find it?","04:13:19","04:13:22",0,"speaker 1"
"You can type alacrity Help.","04:13:28","04:13:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","04:13:38","04:13:39",0,"speaker 1"

"I know it's wrong.","04:13:50","04:13:51",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to hear what's wrong?","04:13:51","04:13:51",0,"speaker 1"
"I know what's wrong.","04:13:51","04:13:52",0,"speaker 1"
"Do you remember when you started it by clicking it?","04:13:53","04:13:55",0,"speaker 1"
"It started up in the wrong directory as not you and you had the CD into home.","04:13:55","04:14:01",0,"speaker 1"
"That's why.","04:14:01","04:14:01",0,"speaker 1"
"So you need to run alacrity from your PowerShell as you first, just to make sure it works.","04:14:03","04:14:11",0,"speaker 1"
"So you are you.","04:14:12","04:14:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Is this not the admin?","04:14:15","04:14:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So now type alacrity.","04:14:17","04:14:19",0,"speaker 1"
"Hopefully it's in the path.","04:14:19","04:14:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Yep, it worked.","04:14:22","04:14:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Is it opening up your alacrity terminal?","04:14:24","04:14:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Should I close this?","04:14:27","04:14:29",1,"speaker 2"
"Is that your alacrity terminal?","04:14:30","04:14:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","04:14:32","04:14:33",0,"speaker 1"

"Wait just a second.","04:14:37","04:14:38",1,"speaker 2"
"I still have this.","04:14:38","04:14:39",1,"speaker 2"
"What the heck was that?","04:14:41","04:14:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, that was a powershell, but all.","04:14:42","04:14:44",0,"speaker 1"
"Right, it did open this.","04:14:44","04:14:46",1,"speaker 2"
"Okay, that's not what you want to type.","04:14:49","04:14:51",0,"speaker 1"

"Yeah, there.","04:14:58","04:14:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, remember, you don't want to type alacrity.","04:14:59","04:15:02",0,"speaker 1"
"You want Alacrity to make sure it launches wsl.","04:15:02","04:15:05",0,"speaker 1"
"So we want to figure out where the settings are.","04:15:06","04:15:08",0,"speaker 1"
"That's what we need.","04:15:08","04:15:09",0,"speaker 1"
"The settings will do all this.","04:15:09","04:15:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So we need is where.","04:15:10","04:15:13",0,"speaker 1"

"You know what?","04:16:31","04:16:31",0,"speaker 1"
"I bet it created it now because you opened it in the crate in the right way.","04:16:31","04:16:35",0,"speaker 1"
"There's some good stuff here.","04:16:39","04:16:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Start the shell in the specified working directory.","04:16:41","04:16:44",0,"speaker 1"

"I didn't know you could start it as a daemon and just open windows.","04:17:04","04:17:08",0,"speaker 1"
"This is all really cool.","04:17:09","04:17:10",0,"speaker 1"
"What you want to do is pass in the file in your mount slot.","04:17:11","04:17:26",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay?","04:17:26","04:17:26",0,"speaker 1"

"Are you ready?","04:17:30","04:17:30",0,"speaker 1"
"Are you ready to try this?","04:17:30","04:17:32",0,"speaker 1"

"All right, so type alacrity.","04:17:34","04:17:37",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm not sure why the cursor seems to be messed up here.","04:17:40","04:17:43",1,"speaker 2"
"Should I escape?","04:17:45","04:17:46",1,"speaker 2"
"Yeah.","04:17:47","04:17:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Control C. I don't know what it's doing.","04:17:48","04:17:50",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know what it's doing, but I'm guessing it has something to do with.","04:17:52","04:17:55",0,"speaker 1"
"You're not in Alacrity now.","04:17:56","04:17:58",0,"speaker 1"
"You're in PowerShell.","04:17:58","04:17:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And who knows what the hell PowerShell is doing.","04:18:01","04:18:04",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","04:18:05","04:18:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's just start with this allocready command.","04:18:07","04:18:14",1,"speaker 2"
"No, command's got to be the last.","04:18:15","04:18:17",0,"speaker 1"
"It said it's a command.","04:18:17","04:18:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Has to be the last word in the thing.","04:18:18","04:18:21",0,"speaker 1"
"What we're going to type is config file and we're going to pass in.","04:18:21","04:18:27",0,"speaker 1"
"We're not going to pass in the config file.","04:18:31","04:18:34",0,"speaker 1"
"That's by default.","04:18:34","04:18:35",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to do space and we're going to do home.","04:18:35","04:18:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you tab that?","04:18:47","04:18:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Will it know what that is?","04:18:48","04:18:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Can you tab?","04:18:49","04:18:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Because it's not C. I don't.","04:18:54","04:18:56",0,"speaker 1"
"I need to know how to access your Linux from here.","04:18:56","04:19:01",0,"speaker 1"
"It's like wsl.","04:19:01","04:19:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, try WSL localhost.","04:19:03","04:19:05",0,"speaker 1"
"But I think there's a slash in the front for root.","04:19:10","04:19:15",0,"speaker 1"
"And now at the very end, press tab.","04:19:16","04:19:18",0,"speaker 1"
"It doesn't do anything.","04:19:21","04:19:22",1,"speaker 2"
"Do another slash and do ubuntu with a capital U.","04:19:23","04:19:28",0,"speaker 1"
"And tab doesn't do anything.","04:19:31","04:19:33",0,"speaker 1"
"Still no.","04:19:33","04:19:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Do a slash, home, slash jaw.","04:19:37","04:19:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Just so we don't have to type all this crap again.","04:19:54","04:19:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Leave that alone.","04:19:56","04:19:56",0,"speaker 1"
"Don't erase it.","04:19:56","04:19:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Click on the Explorer.","04:19:57","04:19:59",0,"speaker 1"
"I think I saw your.","04:20:00","04:20:01",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe we can just right click that.","04:20:01","04:20:03",0,"speaker 1"
"So go to your Explorer, see where it says Linux Ubuntu.","04:20:03","04:20:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Right click that.","04:20:05","04:20:06",0,"speaker 1"
"No, just like this.","04:20:08","04:20:09",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's right click the file itself.","04:20:09","04:20:10",0,"speaker 1"
"Go into home.","04:20:10","04:20:11",0,"speaker 1"
"Jaw.","04:20:12","04:20:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Sorry.","04:20:15","04:20:15",1,"speaker 2"

"Yep, home.","04:20:21","04:20:22",0,"speaker 1"
"I cannot see that.","04:20:24","04:20:25",1,"speaker 2"
"It's at the top, down two, down three, there, double click that and then ja and then dot config and then zishy zish.","04:20:26","04:20:44",0,"speaker 1"
"And then alacrity.","04:20:45","04:20:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And now right click the toml file and let's see what the heck path that is.","04:20:49","04:20:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Copy path.","04:20:56","04:20:57",0,"speaker 1"
"That's right.","04:21:02","04:21:03",0,"speaker 1"
"It has.","04:21:03","04:21:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Windows has backwards things.","04:21:04","04:21:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Whatever.","04:21:06","04:21:06",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, so copy that, go there and go back to where you were kind of typing it and put that in.","04:21:06","04:21:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Erase that.","04:21:15","04:21:15",0,"speaker 1"
"Put it in quotes, just in case.","04:21:15","04:21:17",0,"speaker 1"
"So quote.","04:21:18","04:21:20",0,"speaker 1"
"But don't press enter, because I still want to press space.","04:21:20","04:21:25",0,"speaker 1"
"And we're going to do working dir, which was another one of its options, right?","04:21:26","04:21:31",0,"speaker 1"
"So dash, workingdir Working dash dir and space.","04:21:31","04:21:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Put quotes and just paste again because that was almost.","04:21:42","04:21:47",0,"speaker 1"
"Right.","04:21:47","04:21:48",0,"speaker 1"
"And erase up to where jaw is.","04:21:48","04:21:50",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to.","04:21:50","04:21:50",0,"speaker 1"
"You want to be in your home directory, so erase.","04:21:50","04:21:53",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, now the next is the command you want to run.","04:21:57","04:22:00",0,"speaker 1"
"So space.","04:22:00","04:22:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Now I think they just want you to type the command, right?","04:22:04","04:22:10",0,"speaker 1"
"So let me see, where does it say it?","04:22:10","04:22:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Where does it say hold?","04:22:15","04:22:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, no, they don't.","04:22:18","04:22:19",0,"speaker 1"
"So it's dash e The command and args.","04:22:19","04:22:24",0,"speaker 1"
"So dash, E space, wsl, and I think that's it.","04:22:24","04:22:34",0,"speaker 1"
"Now, if this works, we'll create a shortcut out of this and everything, but.","04:22:36","04:22:40",0,"speaker 1"

"Make it a gist out of it.","04:34:47","04:34:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Make a gist.","04:34:48","04:34:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Do you have notes?","04:34:50","04:34:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Do you have like a Obsidian or a notepad that you stick things in?","04:34:50","04:34:56",0,"speaker 1"
"You can create a file.","04:34:56","04:34:57",0,"speaker 1"
"Actually, we're going to make a shortcut.","04:34:59","04:35:01",0,"speaker 1"
"So what am I talking about?","04:35:01","04:35:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's just see if it works.","04:35:04","04:35:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Press enter.","04:35:06","04:35:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Font not found.","04:35:11","04:35:13",0,"speaker 1"
"Now I thought this in my head.","04:35:18","04:35:20",0,"speaker 1"
"Do we need to install this font in Linux?","04:35:20","04:35:24",0,"speaker 1"
"See, that's a good question, because I.","04:35:27","04:35:28",0,"speaker 1"
"If I'm going to make this happen automatically, I need to know which location it's going to Install.","04:35:28","04:35:34",0,"speaker 1"
"So it will be.","04:35:34","04:35:35",0,"speaker 1"
"Let's see, kind of go here.","04:35:37","04:35:43",0,"speaker 1"
"Oh, oh, no.","04:35:50","04:35:52",1,"speaker 2"
"Can we continue this tomorrow?","04:35:53","04:35:55",1,"speaker 2"
"Because I need to go to the clinic.","04:35:55","04:35:57",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, okay.","04:35:57","04:35:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","04:35:58","04:35:58",1,"speaker 2"
"Dude, it's amazing.","04:35:59","04:36:00",0,"speaker 1"
"Thank you so much for spending time.","04:36:00","04:36:02",0,"speaker 1"
"It was awesome.","04:36:02","04:36:02",0,"speaker 1"
"But maybe I'll have to automate this later next time you come back.","04:36:02","04:36:07",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, sure.","04:36:08","04:36:09",1,"speaker 2"
"All right, Janine, I'll talk to you.","04:36:10","04:36:11",0,"speaker 1"
"I'm not sure if I can.","04:36:11","04:36:13",1,"speaker 2"
"For example, I'll close this.","04:36:13","04:36:15",1,"speaker 2"
"Huh.","04:36:16","04:36:16",0,"speaker 1"
"Which step are we in now?","04:36:17","04:36:19",1,"speaker 2"
"So the.","04:36:19","04:36:20",1,"speaker 2"
"The next time that we.","04:36:20","04:36:21",1,"speaker 2"
"We.","04:36:22","04:36:22",1,"speaker 2"
"We do this again, this is the next step, right?","04:36:22","04:36:27",1,"speaker 2"
"I would take that line, make it a shortcut.","04:36:27","04:36:29",0,"speaker 1"
"It's.","04:36:31","04:36:32",0,"speaker 1"
"That is not going to change like it.","04:36:32","04:36:34",0,"speaker 1"
"The thing that's wrong is like the font configuration.","04:36:34","04:36:37",0,"speaker 1"
"That line, I think is correct.","04:36:37","04:36:39",0,"speaker 1"
"So just.","04:36:40","04:36:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay, go to.","04:36:41","04:36:42",0,"speaker 1"
"I think you can right click your desktop and go create shortcut.","04:36:42","04:36:45",0,"speaker 1"
"And it'll say what executable?","04:36:45","04:36:47",0,"speaker 1"
"And you just paste that whole line in.","04:36:47","04:36:48",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah.","04:36:49","04:36:50",0,"speaker 1"
"Like this.","04:36:50","04:36:51",0,"speaker 1"
"Right?","04:36:51","04:36:51",0,"speaker 1"
"But this is hx.","04:36:51","04:36:53",0,"speaker 1"
"We want shortcut.","04:36:53","04:36:56",0,"speaker 1"
"See that?","04:36:58","04:36:58",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, I want that.","04:36:58","04:36:59",0,"speaker 1"
"And type a name or type the location of the file.","04:37:00","04:37:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Which you can paste, right?","04:37:06","04:37:08",0,"speaker 1"
"It's.","04:37:08","04:37:08",0,"speaker 1"
"You can paste and we can erase.","04:37:08","04:37:10",0,"speaker 1"
"No, we can't.","04:37:10","04:37:11",0,"speaker 1"
"It's a program file.","04:37:11","04:37:12",0,"speaker 1"
"So you got to browse.","04:37:12","04:37:12",0,"speaker 1"
"You know what I mean?","04:37:14","04:37:15",0,"speaker 1"
"You got to browse Pro this PC.","04:37:15","04:37:18",0,"speaker 1"
"Program files.","04:37:18","04:37:19",0,"speaker 1"
"There it is.","04:37:22","04:37:22",0,"speaker 1"
"Program files.","04:37:22","04:37:23",0,"speaker 1"
"And then there it was at the top.","04:37:23","04:37:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Al.","04:37:25","04:37:25",0,"speaker 1"
"Up, up, up.","04:37:26","04:37:28",0,"speaker 1"
"There.","04:37:28","04:37:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","04:37:30","04:37:30",0,"speaker 1"
"And then click.","04:37:31","04:37:32",0,"speaker 1"
"Ok, next, then name it Alacrity.","04:37:32","04:37:37",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, you could finish it, but you're still gonna have to right click it.","04:37:38","04:37:40",0,"speaker 1"
"You have to right click and then go to Properties.","04:37:40","04:37:42",0,"speaker 1"
"Properties.","04:37:44","04:37:45",0,"speaker 1"
"And now start in.","04:37:45","04:37:49",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.","04:37:49","04:37:50",0,"speaker 1"
"What is this?","04:37:53","04:37:54",0,"speaker 1"
"Wait, no, this is.","04:37:54","04:37:55",1,"speaker 2"
"You opened a weird file.","04:37:55","04:37:57",0,"speaker 1"
"This one.","04:37:57","04:37:57",1,"speaker 2"
"This one.","04:37:57","04:37:58",1,"speaker 2"
"Oh, yeah, yeah.","04:37:58","04:37:59",0,"speaker 1"
"That's it.","04:37:59","04:38:00",0,"speaker 1"
"But you don't need the allocating to be any.","04:38:00","04:38:02",0,"speaker 1"
"Because that's assumed in the.","04:38:02","04:38:05",0,"speaker 1"
"Start in the target.","04:38:06","04:38:07",0,"speaker 1"
"See where it says target?","04:38:07","04:38:08",0,"speaker 1"
"So you want Advanced.","04:38:09","04:38:10",0,"speaker 1"
"See where it says advanced at the bottom?","04:38:10","04:38:12",0,"speaker 1"
"Click that.","04:38:13","04:38:14",0,"speaker 1"
"No administrator.","04:38:14","04:38:16",0,"speaker 1"
"I guess Advanced isn't really advanced.","04:38:16","04:38:17",0,"speaker 1"
"Open file.","04:38:17","04:38:18",0,"speaker 1"
"So maybe after it says alacrity, paste the rest of your command.","04:38:18","04:38:23",0,"speaker 1"
"Where target.","04:38:24","04:38:25",1,"speaker 2"
"Or start in where it says here, right?","04:38:25","04:38:28",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, yeah, there.","04:38:28","04:38:29",0,"speaker 1"
"But I'm going to remove this part here.","04:38:30","04:38:34",1,"speaker 2"
"And maybe all of that.","04:38:34","04:38:36",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, maybe.","04:38:37","04:38:38",0,"speaker 1"
"Maybe it all has to go inside the.","04:38:38","04:38:39",0,"speaker 1"
"I don't know.","04:38:39","04:38:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Just try it.","04:38:40","04:38:40",0,"speaker 1"
"Try it.","04:38:40","04:38:41",0,"speaker 1"
"And we'll double click.","04:38:41","04:38:41",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah, it worked.","04:38:46","04:38:48",0,"speaker 1"
"So I'll just.","04:38:48","04:38:49",0,"speaker 1"
"The font thing, you can just use that.","04:38:50","04:38:51",0,"speaker 1"
"The cool part.","04:38:56","04:38:56",0,"speaker 1"
"We're going to install GPT meat.","04:38:57","04:38:59",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay?","04:38:59","04:38:59",0,"speaker 1"
"So whenever you come back, just ping me if it's tomorrow after you sleep.","04:38:59","04:39:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Yeah.","04:39:03","04:39:03",0,"speaker 1"
"Okay.","04:39:04","04:39:04",1,"speaker 2"
"Thank you, Jared.","04:39:05","04:39:06",1,"speaker 2"
