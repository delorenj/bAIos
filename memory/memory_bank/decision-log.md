## WSL Onboarding System Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-08-14 3:17:43 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Building an internal tool for Triumph to provision junior developers' Windows/WSL machines with minimal friction and maximum impact
- **Decision:** Hybrid architecture with web control panel + local agent for cross-boundary execution
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Pure web-based solution (blocked by security constraints)
  - Manual scripts (too complex for junior devs)
  - Desktop-only application (lacks central management)
- **Consequences:** 
  - Enables web UI to orchestrate local system changes
  - Requires secure agent-to-backend communication
  - Allows pre-configured company tokens for authentication
  - Supports future Mac expansion through strategy pattern

## Mise-Centric Tool Management Architecture
- **Date:** 2025-08-14 3:29:45 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Refactoring architecture to use Mise as the central tool manager for Node, Python, uv, pipx, and other development tools
- **Decision:** Replace NodeAgent with MiseAgent that manages all runtime versions and tools through mise
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Individual agents per tool (Node, Python, etc.)
  - Direct tool installation without version manager
  - asdf as alternative to mise
- **Consequences:** 
  - Unified tool version management
  - Simplified agent architecture
  - Consistent tool installation across team
  - Single source of truth for versions
